            "[['\\nTHE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is such a basic Science Fiction story that many first-time viewers have been stunned by the reverence in which it is held. An alien arrives on earth, is misunderstood and is nearly killed, passes a warning to mankind to not carry the weapons of potential nuclear war into space, or face annihilation, then leaves. The FX are minimal, there are no \\'space battles\\' or \\'monsters\\', even the score, by the legendary composer Bernard Herrmann, is simple, lacking the bombast of later \\'epics\\'. Yet in it\\'s very simplicity, director Robert Wise has created a tale more timeless and relevant than many other \\'message\\'-driven SF blockbusters that followed.Based on Harry Bates\\' short story, \"Farewell to the Master\", which paints a far less friendly view of our galactic community (Gort, the enforcer robot, is revealed to be the true \\'Master\\' of the story, not Klaatu, thus revealing that machines are controlling the Universe), 20th Century Fox and director Wise quickly butted heads on how the film should be presented. Fox envisioned Spencer Tracy as Klaatu, believing that the legendary star\\'s well-established persona would make the SF elements more \\'understandable\\' to audiences. Wise scoffed at the notion, arguing that no one would ever believe Tracy was an alien, and searched until he found relative newcomer Michael Rennie, a gaunt, sensitive British actor, whom he felt best suited the Christ-like quality Klaatu had to possess (even the name Klaatu adopted to mingle with humans was \\'Carpenter\\'). For earth\\'s greatest scientist (a thinly-disguised Albert Einstein), Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe, which also brought a howl from the studio, as the actor was being investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the midst of their infamous \\'witch hunt\\' and blacklisting of Hollywood\\'s supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice, however, displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to \\'Dr. Zorba\\' on \"Ben Casey\".\\nRounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal (still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper), Hugh Marlowe (fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE), and Billy Gray (who would go on to great success in \"Father Knows Best\"). The true casting coup, however, was finding 7-foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot, Gort. Encased in foam rubber \\'armor\\' and \\'lifts\\', to bring his height to nearly eight feet (he actually wore two different outfits, as the seam was impossible to hide, and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera), Martin, who, Wise acknowledged, was not a physically strong man, would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion (if you watch him carefully, during the film, you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over). The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant, and the actress, who was afraid, justifiably, that she might be dropped!The filming was, by and large, an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew (although Patricia Neal, in later interviews, said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film\\'s famous \\'tag\\' phrase, \"Klaatu Barrada Nikto\", without breaking into giggles). Everyone knew the end result would be special; Michael Rennie, ten years later, would call the role the most \"important\" of his career (NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film, on \"Saturday Night at the Movies\").With it\\'s anti-war stand, the film was the direct counterpart of the year\\'s other \\'classic\\' SF production, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the first of Hollywood\\'s \\'alien invasion\\' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, \\'Mankind\\' is the true monster, toying with nuclear weapons, constantly fighting, and willing to kill a peaceful emissary, without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. \"Man must grow up, or be destroyed\" was a powerful message, in 1951, particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery, with it\\'s thousands of headstones, as Klaatu/Carpenter viewed, sadly, the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant, today, which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.\\n\\n                    139 out of 157 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Gort and Klaatu were magnificent space travelers...and with a message of peace during a time that the Soviets and U.S. were deep into the 'cold war'.  Very timely!  Very scary!  It spooked me then and I still get a chill watching the movie today.  But, it's one of the classics that will live on forever!  It's message is as meaningful today as it was back in the 50's.

Yes, yes, we\\'re all violent, silly, war-like humans, and we should all throw away our guns and atomic bombs posthaste if we know what\\'s good for us. Thanks, Klaatu. We\\'ll get right on that. Meanwhile, we\\'ll enjoy the chance to watch your story on DVD because we live in an age \\x96 yes, of war and cruelty and weapons of mass destruction \\x96 but also of Jar Jar Binks and \"Alien vs. Predator.\"Klaatu (Michael Rennie) is a gentlemanly outer-space alien who comes to earth in his flying saucer to send us Earthlings a very important message. Sadly, we shoot him on arrival and try to imprison him in a hospital room. He escapes, however, and goes out among us to find the basis for our \"strange, unreasoning attitudes.\" He takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets the widowed Mrs. Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son (Billy Gray). The widow is being romanced by an insurance salesman (Hugh Marlowe), who later displays a lust for glory that endangers Klaatu \\x96 and thus the rest of the world. Klaatu is in better hands when he reveals himself to Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), a brilliant scientist and the best hope for the survival of Earth.It\\'s funny, but I never think about this movie in terms of that plot outline. To me, this film is composed of small moments about people \\x96 especially Mrs. Benson. Mention \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" to me, and the first thing I think about is that moment where the strange new boarder tells her that he\\'d like to spend the day with her son. She hesitates a moment and says in a lowered voice, \"Well, that\\'s awfully nice of you to suggest it.\" It\\'s a tiny moment about her concern for her son, her good manners and her intelligent ability to reply quickly and diplomatically. Patricia Neal, not Gort the robot, makes this movie come alive for me.The real reason this story is so fresh is because \\x96 it\\'s a good story. It\\'s not an excuse to slap us senseless with fast-paced cutting or drown us in great globs of special effects. It has an engaging plot with warm, interesting characters. If we stupidly (and as you know, Klaatu, we humans can be so very stupid) limit ourselves to the New Releases section of the video store, we forget that some sci-fi thrillers put story before special effects.The trick work in this movie is excellent, though. I think the robot looks silly, but when Gort opens its visor and we hear that unnerving theremin music, we don\\'t care that this supposedly metallic creature bends like Styrofoam at the knees. We know those laser beams eyes are about to scorch everything in their sight.Michael Rennie makes up for Gort\\'s deficiencies. He gives what easily could have been a humorless, sanctimonious character a quiet, graceful authority. His slightly otherworldly looks add to the illusion; and Neal as Mrs. Benson completes it by reacting to him with obvious respect \\x96 even when she fears him.Under Robert Wise\\'s direction, every shot is strikingly composed and brings out the maximum dramatic potential of the story. The sense of rhythm and pacing is beautifully suspenseful. Bernard Herrmann, with the theremin as one of his instruments, gives the movie both a nervous tension and a sense of wonder. And the story is so perfectly constructed that it even gets away with a big speech for a climax.What\\'s the heart of this movie? There\\'s a bravura sequence where Billy Gray secretly follows Rennie from the boarding house to his spaceship. It\\'s a simple, wordless scene where the entire team of filmmakers \\x96 and that goes double for Herrmann \\x96 meld the ordinary and the fantastic. You want a special effect? That\\'s it.\\n\\n                    202 out of 237 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

We watched some of The Day the Earth Stood Still and this film just jumped at me, it was so different than any other film I had seen. I thought it was going to be so cheesy and lame since it was a 50\\'s film, but after watching a little bit of it, I didn\\'t realize the strong message it held. I remember in Terminator 2 there was a line that I still hold true to this day \"It\\'s in your nature to destroy yourselves\", that maybe it\\'s not all technology that will destroy us, but we are our own worst enemies. The Day the Earth Stood was before The Terminator, just like Metropolis was before this film, but these are the best stories and it\\'s like watching a history lesson on film about the time and feel of the 50\\'s.An alien spaceship has landed in Washington, D.C., but it\\'s not what you think with the \"take us to your leader\" type of thing, rather a human like alien comes out offering input on what is going on in the universe, but he is immediately attacked by the humans and taken hostage. His name is Klaatu, he tries to explain several times that he\\'s not here to hurt anyone, but the humans don\\'t trust him. He escapes and goes to a family, since no one knows what he looks like, they think that he\\'s a regular man who just needs a place to stay. He stays with a family and they show him around, they think he\\'s a little strange but very polite and nice, but when they learn of his true identity, he tells them of what his intentions are to mearly warn Planet Earth of it\\'s impending doom.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a true classic, I know there are a lot of young people who complain about the ending, how it\\'s so anti-climatic, but I feel that it\\'s a perfect film and I am so ticked off that it\\'s being re-made. But I guess we will have to see what the film will be like, who knows? It might be good... yeah, right, sorry, was just trying to be nice. But I highly recommend you watch this movie, it\\'s a true classic that has a strong message, has great actors, and fun effects. It\\'s fun to watch these films, I wonder if they realized while making this film back in 1951 that they were acting out their own culture and history.10/10\\n\\n                    106 out of 123 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

It studies mans fear of the unknown and the violent reaction it produces even today, and how the love of one person can change the course of events for the better. It's a movie that can still stand on its own even by today's standards and should never be remade.But that's just my opinion.\\n\\n                    159 out of 200 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The story is worthwhile in itself, and as soon as you set aside any preconceptions about what science fiction should involve, it also builds up some pretty good drama and suspense. Its perspective is also interesting to see as a reflection of the concerns of its era, which have such obvious similarities with those of the present.The story itself sometimes moves rather slowly, and the focus is really more on the reactions to Klaatu\\'s arrival than on the action itself. As Klaatu, Michael Rennie stays pretty low-key, as does the rest of the cast much of the time. Although there are times when the movie might lack some energy as a result, in general it probably works better that way than it would have if there were too much forced emphasis on the urgency of Klaatu\\'s mission, which is more than able to speak for itself. The ideas behind the story are fairly simple, but they are, of course, just as significant now (or in practically any other era) as they were in the 1950\\'s.\\n\\n                    52 out of 63 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I don\\'t care to venture any guesses as to what they may be, but it\\'s easy to see why The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the ones from 1951 that remains a classic, while so many others sank into obscurity. The movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples\\' minds in the early 1950s, in America and the rest of the world, and that is the conflicts between many different nations, and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other. It was released at the time of the Red Scare and so soon after World War II that international tensions were still high. Also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title, why, it\\'s not very frightening at all!Okay, that made no sense, but I couldn\\'t resist. My respect for the movie dimmed sharply when I saw that the alien was not only a man, but a good looking man who spoke perfect English, but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years. Unlikely, but it\\'s an explanation, which is more than most science fiction films provide. Granted, not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction, but in this case something had to be said. The alien didn\\'t give may details as to his physical condition, but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human, he must have a similar environment to our own on his planet.Speaking of which, there is one thing about the science that I\\'m also curious about. At what stage were astronomical studies in the early 1950s? I\\'m wondering how far into space scientists were looking, because Carpenter, the alien, states with some grandeur that he has traveled 250 million miles to get to earth, which in astronomical terms is a tiny, tiny distance. Considering that the sun is 93 million miles from earth, this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system. And here\\'s another little factoid \\x96 Earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year, as you know. Pluto, on the other hand, takes something like 248 years to revolve around the sun. That has nothing to do with the movie, but is an interesting digression, I should think.I found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie, and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time. It was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations, and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda (oxymoron intended). I actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument has.When Carpenter (who they stopped just short of simply naming Jesus) was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations, he was genuinely surprised and saddened. He gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the Earth\\'s atmosphere and, since humans clearly are unable to get along, he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration. Most importantly, if we chose the latter, they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space. The descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing, it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one another.This is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that Jonathan Swift presented in Utopia, his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted. They have created robots, which we seen in the Iron Man, to prevent the rise of violence in their society. The robots have tremendous power, which cannot be revoked, and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor, which results in a peaceful society. I\\'m also reminded of Gulliver\\'s Travels, also by Jonathan Swift, particularly the section where Gulliver lives among the Houynymns which, interestingly enough, are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace. When at one point Gulliver describes lying, which does not exist to the Houynymns, one of them responds incredulously with something like, \"Why on Earth would one say something that isn\\'t so?\" Carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings, which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy, maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own world.The famous quote that I\\'ve quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents, and Evil Dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that Ash had such a hard time speaking in Army of Darkness. The genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones, and I think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world, as The Day the Earth Stood Still obviously does. Given the political atmosphere here in the first month of 2005, it\\'s obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie, but then again, as Arnold stated in Terminator 2, \"It\\'s in your nature to destroy yourselves.\"Scary.\\n\\n                    126 out of 188 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Sure, some of the acting and stuff may look a little hokey to jaded modern audiences... but this movie is still extremely well-done... like a movie-length episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" (one of the better ones). A spaceship lands in Washington and a traveler steps forth... before he even has a chance to get a word out, the US Army takes a shot at him... causing his robot companion to destroy some military hardware. The alien, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) tries to reason with the US government but, of course, gets nowhere. So he escapes and travels among humankind to try and get a handle on why people are so suspicious and untrusting. He gets a room in a boarding house and makes friends with a pretty widow (Patricia Neal) and her young son. Mankind has just come upon the means of using atomic energy as a weapon and Klaatu is here to make sure that humans won\\'t pose a threat to other worlds... or else! Well-written, suspenseful and thought-provoking... even today!

I'm not nearly as old as this film and the first time I saw it, I was a young child and impressionable as only young children are. I can honestly say that every alien encounter I've experienced through movies, t.v. shows and literature has been measured against The Day The Earth Stood Still, and most have come up short. I credit the film's depiction of human/alien interactions with my present-day feelings about how people should treat each other - within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders. I think the movie made the young girl I was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come, and in those years I would have become a different person. The effect was deeply profound, and remains so even 30 years after my first screening. That said, it is still entertaining, a joy to revisit. There are no expensive, hi-tech special effects that look great in teasers, but do nothing for the plot. It's very straight forward, honest, pure. It's emotional and intellectual instead of the typical shoot-em-up space battle films that are today's norm. And while I enjoy a good explosion now and then, the change of pace is refreshing.\\n\\n                    14 out of 17 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

One or two moments were slightly puzzling - why does Klaatu allow himself to be interviewed on television, when he knows he is being tracked down?

The character portrayed by Rennie is tall, gentle, intelligent, soothing, yet firm.  Who does he represent? Why Christ of course.His speech, nature, demeanor, and message are all symbolic of a greater power coming back to earth to warn the people what might befall them unless they change their mad march toward destruction.  This character is named appropriately,  Mr. \"Carpenter\" (get the message) and even gets killed by soldiers bent on destroying this evil force from outer space.  Mr Carpenter will even rise from the dead with assistance from his beloved robot assistant.  A great movie that will only get more popular with age.

North from the story Farewell to the Master written by Harry Bates. It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray and Frances Bavier. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Leo Tover. Classic sci-fi is right here as director Robert Wise gives a beautifully steady hand to Harry Bate's short story. Peace for the world or else is the message and I don't see anything wrong with that because it stands up to relevant scrutiny today and unfortunately many days ahead in the future. Debates about the allegorical worth of the film still persist today, but the core message is not up for argument. Wise shows his influences from the time when he worked with Orson Welles and Val Lewton, where here, aided by Tover's beautiful photography, he blends the feel of semi-documentary starkness with film noir visuality. Whether it's scenes of Klaatu (Rennie) trawling the wet night streets, or the interiors of the spaceship and boarding house, the visual imagery by way of low-key lighting compositions is often striking for mood accentuation. All the cast are spot on in their respective performances, with Neal refreshingly given a female role that doesn't resort to her being token sex appeal or a shrieking harpy. Herrmann's understated score is dynamite, and pretty much imitated wholesale from this point onwards, and the film is laced with poignant and frightening scenes that keep the viewer firmly glued to the tale unfolding. The demonstration of the visitors power gives the film its title and it's a glorious slice of celluloid, and in Gort the robot (Lock Martin) we have one of the biggest icons in sci-fi cinema. Once viewed one can never forget The Day The Earth Stood Still, its message, its structured precision and its technical smarts ensure you will remember this film always. One of the most important science fiction movies of all time, a game changer in the critical year for the sci-fi genre. All told it's magic cinema still standing the test of time. 10/10\\n\\n                    13 out of 17 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift, but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon.  Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons.  The alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders.  When he is refused, he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito.  The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950's sci-fi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture \\x96 the score alone has been aped (or lifted in the Simpson's case) in many other films.  The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends, rather than a `beware the red menace' message of fear and hate.  In fact one character even says she thinks the `alien' is from earth (ie Russia) only to be hushed!  The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu's warning of `disarm or we'll remove your threat by destroying you' in the same light. Isn't this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently? I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's pre-emptive strike, while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect \\x96 the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious, but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking (sorry \\x96 accidental pun) at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wide-eyed all American boy (Bobby, but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy) to see the whole thing, but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism, but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a pre-emptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.\\n\\n                    15 out of 22 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I watched it today, and I am not disappointed. It is historical, it has a good script with good acting, and it is the kind of movie that you can notice different things each time you view it.

He comes out, announces that he comes in peace, and is promptly shot by a nervous military man. He looks mid-30s, is actually 78 years old, and his wound heals in a day, obviously from an advanced race some 250 million miles away. His planet has been monitoring Earth, they are a peaceful people who built robots to monitor them and destroy any signs of aggression. They sent Klaatu to Earth to warn us, if we don\\'t solve our multi-nation conflicts, they would destroy Earth. After WW II and the atomic bomb, they have become concerned that an Earth nation would eventually threaten their civilization and peace.Of course there had to be a demonstration that Klaatu and his robot could really do this, so he did this at noon the next day, all over the Earth electricity was \"neutralized\" for exactly one half hour. Even batteries did not work, so cars and motorcycles or lawnmowers wouldn\\'t run, no phone, elevators, assembly line, etc. All except planes in the air and hospitals.To appreciate this film you have to realize WW II with the atomic bomb had ended only a few years earlier. The \"cold war\" was in full swing, with world-wide fear of the spread of Communism. So this was really a film with a message, to make a statement, that our nations need to figure out a way to live in peace or our Earth may be destroyed.It is curious watching the film\\'s message today, only a month after President Bush gave Saddam Hussein of Iraq essentially the same message that Klaatu gave in the movie - disarm or we\\'ll destroy you.

The plot is very simple, but it is the way it is developed what is very moving, thought-provoking and also, quite scary. On a normal day, an alien space ship lands on Washington creating panic, when the mysterious visitor appears, he is suddenly attacked by the army. Surviving the attack, the alien explains that his purposes are pacific, and that he has an important message for the world. The U.S. government, immersed in its international intrigues, wants to have the message for themselves, but the alien, Klaatu(Michael Rennie) won\\'t give it to them only, as it is a message important for all the creatures on earth.The movie works at many levels, but at its core, it is an anti-war movie. Written in protest against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, it reflects the fears of the society in the 50s and the fear of nuclear holocaust. While Klaatu\\'s ultimate solution may seem like a bigger threat, it was indeed toned down, since in the source story it was the robot, Gort, who was the real master. It is a powerful message, and it is handled perfectly by Wise, in scenes when Klaatu in disguise, explores human nature guided by a boy.Unlike most of the sci-Fi movies, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" has not dated badly, in fact, its message remains as powerful and valid as the day it was released. The wars, the intrigues and complexities of our society make almost impossible the dream of world peace, and Klaatu\\'s perfect society seems unreachable for us.The superb work of Robert Wise would not be the same if it wasn\\'t for his SFX team, who did amazing things with very little. Also, the cast is superb, and while the dialogs may sound corny now, it is a very good script. Sure, it may have its share of plot holes, but the movie carries the message well and the overall product is near perfect.The acting is a bit typical of the 50s, nevertheless, it is worth to mention the superb performances of Michael Rennie as Klaatu, Sam Jaffe as the lead scientist and Billy Gray as the kid, Bobby Benson, who shows Klaatu the human world.The movie makes many points, and has various interpretations, from religious allegory to political critic, the story is timeless indeed. Many words could be written about this movie as it is one classic of cinema history that must be seen at least once in a life time. While we are probably too far from Klaatu\\'s perfect world, and the fear of a ultimate war is still present, we can hope that one day peace will be achieved.10/10.

Sometimes, it's for their groundbreaking special effects, like the original King Kong (1933) or The War of the Worlds (1953). Sometimes it's because they have a particularly interesting character or villain like Frankenstein (1931) and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). And sometimes it's because they feature a creature that absolutely frightens or haunts you like Count Orlok in Nosferatu (1922). But there's only a handful of classics out there that get their recognition because of a moral message they carry. One such example is the original, Japanese version of Godzilla (1954). Another is the 1951 revolutionary classic The Day the Earth Stood Still.This memorable motion picture, recently remade with Keanu Reeves, and based on a story by Harry Bates, tells the fictional tale of an event in history when a flying saucer landed in Washington D.C. Two extra terrestrial beings emerged from its mysterious form. A humanlike messenger named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and an eight-foot-tall, invulnerable robot called Gort (Lock Martin). These two beings arrive upon the era where mankind had began to strongly develop atomic energy and increase the violent and catastrophic potential of its warfare. The extra terrestrials arrive with a warning for all of mankind. By harnessing such horrible power and using it to create weapons, mankind was creating an intergalactic threat as well as endangering its own existence on Earth. Klaatu's warning was simple: cut off the production of nuclear weapons and live in peace, or be destroyed as a threat to other worlds in the universe.Like many other popular science-fiction films, The Day the Earth Stood Still features impressive visual effects. Even the robot, Gort, which is nothing more than a man in a flexible costume, looks like a machine made from foreign-world material. The scenes where the UFO lands in Washington D.C. and where a death ray sprays into a tank and dissolves it in a flash of white light still spellbind to this day. But its more notable elements were created by the characters and by the screenwriters.The extra-terrestrial, Klaatu looks remarkably human. He doesn't have antenna, or three eyes, or tentacles, and his physical form is not a disguise. Oddly enough, this is more convincing than the present standards for aliens, which have to look like animals, particularly invertebrates, to be believable. And because he looks human, Klaatu is more relatable as a being instead of a creature. And he has morals, again, relatable and more compelling a buggy-eyed, other-planet nihilist bent on enslavement and destruction. And besides, they way I see it, if there are other beings out in the world, they wouldn't be much different than us. Physically or morally.Another noteworthy element is its symbolism, which like Godzilla (1954) stands out against nuclear war and the destruction of the environment. While it does not carry its message as vividly and horrifyingly, director Robert Wise wisely influences this message several times to keep it fresh in our minds. And while a movie cannot change the world, it is comforting to know that there were, and still are good people who realize these nightmarish elements of our world and feel compelled enough to communicate a message to us.The Day the Earth Stood Still has aged a bit since its debut in 1951, but this does in no way, take away from its influence. It has deservedly earned his place in the long list of classics from the age when true motion pictures were made instead of the standard, hackneyed projects that seem to attract audience members today in the 21st century.\\n\\n                    10 out of 15 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North\\'s fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man\\'s capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie\\'s urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto.....

Enter General Eisenhower, who would become a two-term U.S. President; \"Father Knows Best\", with its stern but loving father figure; and the iron-fisted biblical epic: \"The Ten Commandments\".Enter, too, \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\", a 1951 sci-fi classic soaked in images of authority ... the police, the military, and the tall, stern, Moses-like figure from another world, Klaatu, who lectures us on the folly of nuclear war. It is, I believe, this pacifist message emanating from strength that explains the film\\'s enduring popularity.Noble as the message is, what about its cinematic vehicle? Visually and musically, the film is appropriately frigid and forbidding. Leo Tover\\'s noirish B&W lighting and unobtrusive camera work, combined with Bernard Herrmann\\'s score and the eerie theramin sounds all work in concert to convey a mood of Orwellian severity and other worldly coldness.But the script is disappointing. This is a very talky film, which dilutes its effectiveness as sci-fi. The dialogue seems stodgy, canned, uninspired. Example: \"attention zone 5, attention zone 5, yellow cab moving north ... man and woman in backseat; get license number and report ... deploy all units according to Plan B immediately\" (well, at least it was not Plan 9...).This pedestrian script could have been borrowed from most any cops and robbers flick of the 40\\'s. On the other hand, I guess I can forgive the script\\'s moratorium on humor, given the seriousness of the message.The film\\'s science is very dated, thus requiring further tolerance. Klaatu to scientists: \"The universe grows smaller every day\"; no, actually the physical universe is expanding. \"Venus and Mars ... are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it\"; no, not with their temperature extremes and chemical composition.And the special effects are curiously minimal in the same era that produced the beautifully weird gliding machines from Mars in \"War Of The Worlds\" (1953), and the lurking terror in \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956).One solid accomplishment of this film is its accurate portrayal of society in the early 1950\\'s: the old cars, men\\'s formal attire (especially those hats), interior decor, antiquated TV sets, and of course the confidence in institutional authority.In summary then, the movie, for me, functions less as a credible sci-fi vehicle than as a fascinating socio-political commentary on American life in the early 1950\\'s.\\n\\n                    43 out of 85 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn\\'t concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I\\'ve never seen a person say, \"2001: A Space Odyssey? I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?\", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you \"get it\" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is \"...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness.\" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that\\'s sheer genius at its highest form.At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, \"Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?\" The New York Times remarked, \"Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring.\" \"Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,\" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 \"trash masquerading as art\". It\\'s understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for \"if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning\", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause \"cultural shock and social disorientation\". It\\'s a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.Yet apes are not much better. They\\'re not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There\\'s something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that\\'s so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing \"Daisy\" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity\\'s fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn\\'t have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous \"Star Gate\" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo\\'s The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a \"Space Baby\", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it\\'s a question for you to answer.There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001\\'s composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky\\'s work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick\\'s artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.But of course, it\\'s impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it\\'s hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what\\'s the point? You don\\'t need me to appreciate 2001\\'s immaculate visuals.Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, \"North\\'s (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.\"\"But why all the slow parts?\" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity\\'s fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot\\'s average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would\\'ve been a mess. Space isn\\'t fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it\\'s now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI \"Sight and Sound\" Critics\\' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director\\'s poll, places 15th on AFI\\'s 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of \"greatest science-fiction films of all time\".2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it\\'s transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.\\n\\n                    642 out of 753 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn\\'t make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don\\'t really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I\\'m just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it \"art\" or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can\\'t reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.\\n\\n                    263 out of 353 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as \"boring\" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick\\'s accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in \"science fiction\", and its depiction of space travel and mankind\\'s future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn\\'t caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film\\'s greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn\\'t made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that\\'s just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can\\'t work out how some of the shots were done.  The film\\'s only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind\\'s technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick\\'s.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that\\'s the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it\\'s up to the audience to continue.  There\\'s no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that\\'s what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn\\'t going to let us off so lightly.I\\'m glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.\\n\\n                    1,458 out of 2,050 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you\\'ll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film\\'s plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.   \\'2001\\' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don\\'t get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they\\'re not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy \\'2001\\' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.  \"All art is quite useless\" -  Oscar Wilde.\\n\\n                    1,179 out of 1,721 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.\\n\\n                    660 out of 992 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite \"trip\" movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick\\'s directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters\\' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL\\'s glowing red \"eye\" to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle\\'s opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001\\'s meaning in general is, I\\'d like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience\\'s intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man\\'s past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.\\n\\n                    974 out of 1,498 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The idea of man\\'s rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.\\'s \"Zarathustra\"; there is a prominent passage called \"On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child\", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that \"man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman.\" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in \"Zarathustra\", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn\\'t have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to \"go under\". Bowman\\'s psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick\\'s best 1960\\'s-style attempt at depicting the mystical \"going under\".I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean.

It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.\\n\\n                    402 out of 646 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there's an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste. Intellectuals will take the position that you are a mentally challenged clod if you dare disagree with their elevated opinion of the movie--so be aware that this is not conventional story-telling in any sense whatsoever and only for those who admire Stanley Kubrick's way with unlikely cinematic material.\\n\\n                    232 out of 371 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

And that\\'s not because I can\\'t appreciate \"art\". I love a good film with profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and great directing.This film just isn\\'t one of them.My main complaint about this film is that it\\'s so horribly slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there\\'s not enough exposition to let people who haven\\'t read the book know what\\'s going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn\\'t figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith\\'s singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn\\'t read the book.*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we\\'re back outside traveling at a snail\\'s pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it\\'s \"realistic\" to portray it as such, but we still don\\'t need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its \"realism\". Let me tell you about this \"realism\" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I\\'m a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I\\'m supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He\\'s great. And the \"Open the pod bay doors\" sequence is wonderful. But it\\'s too short. And it\\'s not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing \"Daisy, Daisy\", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy\\'s whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.I\\'m not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don\\'t quite get it myself. Supposedly he\\'s in an alien research laboratory and they\\'re teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it\\'s just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film, it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It\\'s that boring.Call this crummy film \"art\" if you wish. I wouldn\\'t. I\\'ve seen more interesting \"art\" in the local museum.

You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a platter.Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue, and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit, and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then, apparently, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and evolves at Jupiter.This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing.

Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book.

It\\'s an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...But \"2001\" reveals that it\\'s not really a science fiction film after all...

Kubrick relates a chronology in images of things\\x97the mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock\\'s \"Psycho\"), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture\\'s vision of man...

The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the \"Starchild\" returning home to charm the orb...\"2001\" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...\"2001\" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery...

I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene, which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty, for about 5 minutes, but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement, you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid, because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid, because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot, which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining, therefore plot is missing. I have to admit, that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence, where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted, that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe, if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend, who praised the movie, suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying, that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes, I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie, it wouldn't be boring, because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up: Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes. It is not a bad movie, but also definitely not great and it is certainly not mediocre.\\n\\n                    184 out of 312 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

While the latter is extremely personal and diverse, some convergence can be achieved in the former. Unfortunately, this piece greatly fails in it: no plot, no original ideas, no action, horrible cinematography, and a very repetitive soundtrack. As far as the emotional impression goes: well, in my case, it gave me a highly unpleasant aftertaste: a very pretentious schizophrenic nightmare...Why is it so overrated then? I\\'d hypothesize that it is for the same reason as in the case of Malevich\\'s \"Black Square\". When one sees something a piece of \"art\" of that type, there seem to be two typical reactions: (i) \"There is nothing there, it is junk.\" and (ii) \"There is nothing there but it must be great because everyone else thinks it\\'s great.

About half way through I realised that it was getting too long, and I should perhaps be more concise with my review. This however, showcases the huge amount of substance and detail to be found in this film. In my opinion, the best films aren't the ones that tell you things. The best films are the ones that ask you questions, so that you can think about it for yourself.The biggest theme in this film, in my opinion, is tools. Near the beginning of the film we are watching two tribes of apes just after the creation of the world. They are rival tribes, but then there is a pivotal moment which changes everything. One tribe discovers tools, in the form of using dead animal bones as weapons, and they are automatically superior. When one apes is playing, smashing a bone against another bone, he throws it up in the air and we witness one of my favourite cuts of all time. Suddenly it cuts to a spaceship with a similar shape, millions of years later, and we come to witness the tools that were discovered by the apes now defining who the humans are. The place they are staying in, a spaceship, is a tool. Breathing, which should be a wholly natural thing, can only be done through a tool. A man's only means of contacting his family is through a tool. For a large part of the film the characters wear spacesuits which, to me, although it is all up to interpretation, is symbolic, as, without their spacesuits (a tool) they would be naked. Later in the film, we spend a long time following an expedition to Jupiter which has on board an artificial intelligence computer, HAL, an astronaut Dave, and about three other Astronauts in hibernation. The thing that is striking about this section of the film is that Dave and the other Astronaut who awakens, both give extremely unrealistic and unemotional performances. That probably sounds like a bad thing to you, but that's exactly what the director wanted to convey. The fascinating thing about it is that in a ship full of a number of humans and a computer, the computer seems to have the most humanity.In this section, the two Astronauts decide HAL the computer, has gone out of control and they must unplug him. HAL finds out, and a fascinating situation arises. HAL feels fear. Here, it is easy to view HAL as a one dimensional villain who just wants to destroy things, but really, I think he fears being unplugged in the same way a person would fear being killed. I also think he reacts in quite a human way, killing the the Astronauts in order to save himself. However, Dave reaches HAL's control room and so begins a scene that I think is more disturbing than most things you find in a 12 (I'm British, but I think that translates to a PG-13 in the USA). In this scene Dave unplugs HAL and the most interesting question in the film arises. Is this murder? Whichever way, this is a very sad scene as HAL shows genuine human sadness and fear. At the end of the film, after an odd sequence consisting of Dave going through a light, colour tunnel and then seeing various landscapes in weird inverted colours, he lands in an eighteenth century room. This is a highly debated scene and is completely open to interpretation, but I will give my views on it:In this scene, I think that Dave, has travelled so far out, that time and space are insignificant. What I mean is that he has travelled to a place where it doesn't matter where, or when you are, time moves randomly. You could be in the eighteenth century, you could be on earth, you could keep getting older or you could keep getting older, (which all happen to him): it doesn't matter. And then what I think is the most ambiguous ending in film history unfolds. A much much older version of him appears dying on a bed, then you see a baby on the bed replacing where he was which grows and in the final shot you see it next to the earth, a similar size. So what does the ending mean? What does the film mean? What is it saying about tools? Was the unplugging of HAL really murder? Is HAL really human? What makes us human? Is it trying to imply we are too reliant on tools? Perhaps it is trying to imply that we ourselves are becoming the tools, as the beings with the least humanity. This brings me to my first point. 2001 never makes any statements it, only asks questions. And the great thing about that is that, they are interesting questions I can think about for as long as I want and never come to a conclusion, as I don't think there ever was one.\\n\\n                    52 out of 84 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Over the internet, in your college maybe--a student or possibly a philosophy/art/film professor. A person with a passion for avante-garde films with wacky imagery and little else. They're the type of people who find a college thesis' worth of material from the dialogue in the Matrix sequels, they're the ones that boldly declare a film 'art' and anybody else who disagrees with them 'just didn't get it.' 2001 is art alright. The kind of art that I can only liken as being assaulted and nearly beaten to death by an Andy Warhol painting. Yes this movie is art, and you will hate it for that.This is a shame since normally I like Stanley Kubrick movies, but 2001 is an experiment in film-making and nothing more. The plot is incredibly vague, revolving around monkeys battling a black monolith, a mission to space, and a computer program called Hal going insane since that's what most self-conscious computer programs do. The film is then peppered with other psychedelic imagery that are supposed to convey grand ideas. They'll only convey those types of things if you're pretentious and into that kind of thing, otherwise you'll view it as utterly pointless.2001 revolves around these whacked-out, LSD-induced images to string together some kind of story that interests you. It does not. A parade of shots that have little to do with one another and randomly show things happen does not a movie make.There are no doubt going to be people out there who will try to explain 2001's plot and why you should accept it as being a wonderful film. The thing is this: much like if you have to explain a joke then it isn't funny, it's the same thing with movies. If you have to explain to someone the plot and its various interpretations, then it isn't a good movie.Ultimately I can't change the opinion of the viewers and critics that loved 2001, but if 2001 proves anything it's this: keep your art to yourself.\\n\\n                    387 out of 713 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It\\'s a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he\\'s quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels \"the dawn of mankind\", near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It\\'s disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren\\'t nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It\\'s almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we\\'re not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be \"interpreted\" by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making.\\n\\n                    300 out of 572 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Earlier that year, during a family trip to San Francisco, we had stopped to eat at a Howard Johnson\\'s diner, and with our meal I had received a comic book promoting the film (if you\\'ll remember, one of Kubrick\\'s less astute predictions was that Howard Johnson\\'s would be the food franchise on the Space Station). After the mind-blowing revelation of that comic book, I suffered through four or five months waiting for my chance to see it.It took two tries. The first try was the weekend that the Apollo 7 mission became the first to circle the moon. My dad took not only me but also my mom and six-year-old brother. We drove the thirty miles to Hollywood......only to find that \"2001\" was sold out.Quickly we checked the paper for a suitable alternative. There was an ad for another interesting looking sci-fi film playing just a few blocks up Hollywood Boulevard... \"Barbarella.\" This was literally just a week or two before the ratings system went into affect, so the only way we had to judge the suitability of the subject matter was by the ad, which was illustrated with goofy, fun-looking cartoons. \"I wanna see Bar-bella!\" my brother cried excitedly. It looked good to me too. So off we went.Try to imagine sitting next to your fairly prudish mother in 1968, watching -- without any warning -- Jane Fonda\\'s zero-gravity striptease. And then every stripe of fetishism and polymorphous perversity, under only the thinnest satirical sci-fi camouflage. I remember afterward, out in the lobby, my dad kneeling by my sniffling brother, gently explaining \"Those dolls couldn\\'t really have been biting her,- they COULDN\\'T really bite her because their teeth were angled inward, if they were really going to bite her their teeth would have had to angle OUT, so you see...\"But I digress.On our second try, dad took just me. This time we got in. The theater was huge, with dark red curtains. The screen was huge, but thankfully not deeply curved like a Cinerama screen. (Over the decades since then, I have seen \"2001\" several times at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, where the screen IS deeply curved. Every time the spaceship Discovery is shown from the side, it curves up at the ends like a smile. By the nature of its visual geometry \"2001\" was meant to be seen on a FLAT screen.)The overture began, weird otherworldly sounds like I\\'d never heard before, as the auditorium lights slowly dimmed. And then, that amazing stylized MGM logo, created specifically for \"2001\" and never used at the head of any other film (although MGM did later adopt it for a time as their corporate logo). And then the thrilling swell of \"Also Sprach Zarathustra,\" and that awesome lineup of the moon, the Earth and the Sun! An image like nothing ever seen before on a movie screen. Or in real life either: \"2001\" was showing us vistas of our solar system that NASA photography had yet to capture even approximately.Half the time I had no idea what was going on. But I didn\\'t care. To me it seemed like a film FROM the year 2001. I was enthralled, and goaded to TRY to understand. More than any other film I can think of, \"2001\" really lived up to that oft-misused cliché phrase: it \"made me think.\"Driving home that night, I remember doing the math: in 2001 I\\'ll be forty-three. I\\'ll SEE all that!My dad died in 2001.\\n\\n                    48 out of 82 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Indeed, this seems to be the most profitable kind of film to make, with the family-oriented often translating to the lowest common denominator. There is a rare kind of film in this oversaturated market, however. Namely, the film that claims it can entertain an audience in almost any age bracket, and really can deliver on this promise. I know how this sounds, so bear with me a moment.Short Circuit is, at heart, a comedy about what happens when a robot designed to replace a special forces soldier is struck by lightning, and starts to believe he is a living entity. Much of the rest of the film revolves around either Number 5\\'s attempts to evade capture by the people who made him, or his attempts to convince the people he meets of the truly wonderful thing that has happened to him. Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg provide an excellent support cast that does a first rate job of interacting with the character. This was one of the first films to show human actors engaging in conversation with what was essentially a full-scale puppet, and it remains one of the best. With brilliant voice acting by Tim Blaney, Number 5 seems more human than some of the other actors in the film, especially G.W. Bailey. They must have had a special on Police Academy alumni that year.Speaking of Police Academy, the \"let\\'s rip the front seats out and sit in the back\" joke gets a couple of references here. In fact, a few old classics get a good reference in this effort. Interestingly enough, the Three Stooges short that is shown and imitated in a couple of sequences is called Woman Haters. Go figure. The one weakness of the film is that it seems primarily constructed around a few puppeteering or special effects sequences. The use of the laser beams here seems very dated by modern standards, and the computers would look unbelievable if I hadn\\'t personally seen the computers that were available to the public and business around this year.Sadly, they do not make films like this anymore. In this day and age, where every film has to be made as expensively as possible, and even films aimed at children seem segmented, nobody seems willing to consider that the adults in the audience might need to be entertained, too. Which is a real pity. Films like Short Circuit have the ability to appeal to this viewer even more now that he is twenty-something years old than was the case when he was eight years old. I doubt that anyone who turns twenty-six in 2020 is going to same the same about the Pokemon or other such mind-numbing single-digit-age-only crap that is being churned out.I gave Short Circuit an eight out of ten. It is starting to show its age, but as a relic of the mid-1980s, it also shows that there were people asking questions about the advancement of technology. Indeed, on the basis of films like Short Circuit, I am almost willing to regard the 1980s as the last bastion of creativity in the mainstream film industry. Give it a look expecting a film about more than money, and you may be pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n                    80 out of 87 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

There is a real emphasis on quality screen writing here which only comes through on a small ratio of films. The characters could easily have become 2 dimensional stereotypes, but instead given some interesting dialogue and motives (science, military etc).

Maturer audiences will have a hard time overlooking some of the childish nuances of the movie, but it is such a fun and entertaining family film that all of those things can be easily forgiven. It reminds me of other wonderful family films like Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies, that I used to watch over and over when I was a kid. I feel like I\\'ve lost something when I can\\'t think of a single movie now that I love so much that I will watch it a few times a week. Maybe I just am more aware of the time involved in watching the same movie over and over today than I used to be. Johnny 5 is a robot designed for military use until one day it\\'s struck by lightning and, apparently, comes to life. This is a pretty tired formula, something man-made suddenly displaying life-like qualities and wanting to be recognized as a real boy, but it\\'s accompanied by some clever messages about the advancement of technology, particularly technology designed to replace humans, which has always been seen as a bit of a dangerous idea, criticized brilliantly by everyone from Charlie Chaplin to James Cameron. Johnny 5\\'s adventures involve his efforts to avoid capture by the people who made him (\"NOVA! No!!\"), while at the same time trying to prove to the world that he\\'s a living entity now. They could not make a movie like this today. Sadly, CGI has forever replaced the need to create a physical robot like the one that plays Johnny 5 in this movie, so any Short Circuit that was made today would just be some soul-less digital effect cavorting across the screen, instantly forgettable. But here, he\\'s really there, and he\\'s heavy and clumsy and metallic, but so memorable as a movie character that I\\'ve recently read that the actual robot prop was sold for something like $500,000. Now THAT is a fan!Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy have a cute chemistry on screen that is satisfactorily simple. They are both cookie-cutter caricatures, Sheedy the lonely Stephanie, who drives an ice-cream truck for a living, and Guttenberg plays a scientist named Newton, who works for the evil NOVA but who only needs a cute ice-cream lady and a charming robot to change his evil ways. Sound like fun? No? Well, it is, trust me. The film has definitely dated, but I\\'ll take special effects that look dated 20 years later over expensive CGI that never looked real in the first place any day.

One of the robots, 'Number Five', escapes and finds sanctuary in the home of Stephanie Speck (Allly Sheedy), a nice lady with a soft spot for runaways. Speck becomes good friends with 'Number Five' who begins to take on a lot of human characteristics, transcending the static life of a robot or the hostile life of a military weapon, which is what the robots were designed for. Speck learns that Number Five's owners are looking for him, but she knows that the military would only destroy Number Five or terminate the emotional drive that he has developed. Number Five's designer, Newton Crosby (Guttenberg) and his silly assistant Ben Jabituya (Stevens), have yet to appreciate what Number Five has achieved, as a shell of wires and controls able to take on human qualities, but, soon, they too will join Speck in the quest to save 'Number Five.' Some of it is kind of reminscint of other 80s sci-fi movies like 'Batteries Not Included' and 'E.T.' There's two issues at work in this movie. The first, and obvious one being about the development of human emotion and would it be possible for anything to gain an understanding and appreciation for it? And the second being the ethics of military useage. Plus, it's your standard 80s love and friendship story. Because of the story and the sharp wit comedy and sarcasm, it's makes for good comedy.

I think that's because 'Number Five' is such a funny, loveable robot.If you like the theme of this movie, I recommend seeing the hilarious comedy, 'Making Mr. Right,' which is about a robot designed for space exploration rather than military use. But, the robot begins to take on human emotions while the owner becomes increasingly more like a robot.

Though if you look beyond the computer components and the boring banter of this high tech machine facility, what we have is a quite an adventurous, and surprise fun flick. When a experimental robot, among a score of them, is electrocuted and grows smarts and takes off from the facility to tour the splendour of San Francisco, it's creator, likable Guttenberg, a stay in, and his peers, one another Police Academy favourite, are desperate to recover it, where they do whatever it takes. The robot is befriended by a female vet, sweet Sheedy who harbours it, and the two become great friends. The manipulation of the robot is very smart as from the designers of it, and the escape sequences are so well done. Too, I liked the geeky, sleepy voice of one of the managers, as if illustrating sarcastically the enjoyment of this job. Fisher Stevens is a hoot as Guttenberg's assistant, who lectures him on how there's another world outside the facility. SC pretty much has the same kind of approaching climax, whether it's ET, Starman, where Sheedy, who of course strikes up a relationship with Guttenberg, will protect Johnny Five at all costs, from the facility guy who will turn back into an experiment. Not being a lover of kid's flicks, though I was more flexible as a teen, this film had grown on me, and it's song from El Debarge rocks. Certainly a movie for all ages, this couldn't be a more perfect flick for everyone. Of course it spawned a not as successive sequel, not in the same class as the first, with only Stevens staying for it.\\n\\n                    6 out of 6 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

One of the robots, Number Five, is hit by lightning and as a result is able to become \"alive\". He escapes from Nova and befriends a woman named Stephanie and begins to gain a lot of \"input\" and learns a lot. Nova plans on capturing him, but Number Five realizes that he must not get captured in order to remain alive.First off I have to say that this film is a comedy and much of it should not be taken seriously. By that I mean that the depiction of the military group of Nova constantly bickering and having lame discussions is something that film intended on doing.The acting and human characters are pretty odd in this film. I can see why Steve Guttenberg is constantly criticized by viewers. He is just a boring not funny guy who makes robots in this film. Ally Sheed plays Stephanie, a really naive and not that intelligent veterinarian. Also the character of Ben being a Caucasian who speaks like an Indian Person is something that I think is pretty funny, if not a bit racist as well. But for the most part the human characters are not special at all and completely overshadowed.They attempt to make a love story with Guttenberg and Sheed\\'s character. However it comes off as rushed and horrible and I did not buy it. If anything the romance with Number five and Stephanie is much more convincable.The reason for this film being good is Number Five. Number Five is one of the greatest robot characters ever in a film. Hilarious, intelligent, and highly entertaining. He can do anything. It is quite interesting seeing him gain input and learn a lot about the world. It is not common for a robot to steal the show and make a movie good just by itself, but this is one case where that happens and the film is good because of it.Quite an interesting film. Lame acting and human characters. However a great character in Number Five. I recommend this film to viewers because of Number Five.\\n\\n                    6 out of 6 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

After they show how the can eliminate a variety of vehicles everybody goes inside and the robots are recharged... while robot number five is still connected to the generator there is a lightning strike which causes it to malfunction. After a collision with a rubbish disposal robot it ends up on the back of a lorry with the rubbish and is taken off the base. At around the same time it is noticed that he is missing and everybody at Nova, the company that made it, starts to panic. Skroeder, the head of security sets off with his men to catch it while its inventor Dr. Newton Crosby and his assistant Ben Jabituya follow its tracking signal to help them locate it. They find Number Five but it evades capture by jumping off a bridge and parachuting on to the back of a van driven by Stephanie, by now it is out of range for the tracker.When Stephanie finds Number Five she initially thinks he is an alien and invites it into her house where he seeks input, he quickly reads every book in the house and turns to the television for further learning. When she learns that instead of being an alien he is a robot from a weapons manufacturer she is not impressed and calls them to take it away, however when she tells Number Five that he is to return to Nova he reacts in a way one wouldn't expect from an inanimate object... he shows fear. Realising that he is in danger Number Five takes Stephanie's van which he learns how to drive by reading the instruction manual. She manages to jump aboard as he drives off but they crash and are found be Doctor Crosby who deactivates Number Five and puts him on a truck bound for Nova. Five however manages to reactivate himself and escapes once again. He returns to Stephanie and is present to help rescue her from her abusive ex-boyfriend. She believes that if she can persuade Doctor Crosby that Number Five is alive then he well help them, unfortunately they meeting is interrupted by Skroeder and as well as rescuing Stephanie Number Five must confront the other robots, I won't say what he does to them as it would spoil one of the films jokes.As stated before the film still seems charming and Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg performed well in the lead roles and while watching it was easy to suspend disbelief and accept that Number Five was indeed alive. I'm not sure what to make of Fisher Stevens's portrayal of Ben Jabituya, on the one hand he was an amusing character, on the other it seemed very dated to have a white actor playing an Indian rather than actually employing somebody from the Sub-continent. There are one or two jokes some parents might find a bit racy but I think most children would enjoy this film as will plenty of adults, especially those who first saw it as youngsters in the '80.\\n\\n                    5 out of 5 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

There are some truly hilarious scenes e.g. the 3 Stooges tribute and excellent effects which have easily stood the test of time.

In 1986, \"Short Circuit\" was released. It is the tale of a robot strictly made for military purposes who happens to get struck by lightning and afterwards develops human-like characteristics. As he becomes self-aware, the robot (named Number Five) escapes the NOVA laboratory compound, now on the run from the scientists he fears will capture and \"kill\" him. \"Short Circuit\" certainly captured my heart and it should be recommended to everyone looking for an enjoyable movie filled with many opportunities for a good laugh. Alas, besides being a \"cutesy\" movie, \"Short Circuit\" doesn\\'t contain much depth or intricacy after that; the three main supporting characters are simple, with only a single defining characteristic to their personalities and the plot follows a very basic structural outline.Stephanie, Newton, and Skroeder are the three main supporting characters that were mentioned above; more or less, they are flat, 2-D characters. Stephanie is an animal pacifist; her only role is to show Number Five some compassion and protect him from harm. Newton is a scientist, so his character role is to track down Number Five, study him, and make sense of these human-characteristics. And finally, Skroeder is the ultimate brawn behind the capture mission so his only role is to annihilate Number Five. Each character represents a single idea and solely keeps to that lone idea throughout the entire film; thus there are no other significant characteristic differences between the characters. Likewise, the plot is quite similar: it is not overly complex by any means and really only follows an easy, skeletal outline. There\\'s an initial event that takes place in the beginning and that event is followed by a cat-chase-mouse action sequence which lasts nearly the entire movie. It\\'s very similar to the television cartoon, \"Tom and Jerry.\" The cartoon is based upon a cat, Tom, chasing a mouse, Jerry; likewise, Skroeder and Newton chase after Stephanie and Number Five. Then, at the very end of the movie, there is (of course) a happily ever after resolution causing the film to leave a warm and pleasant feeling in the watchers\\' heart. \"Short Circuit\" is a simple story of the \"good guys vs. the bad guys,\" with the moral of the story being: all life is important and it\\'s erroneous to kill. If you happen to be searching for a movie with an overly deep plot and complex characters, you\\'ll want to look elsewhere. \"Short Circuit\" is a humorous, lovable, simplistic kids\\' movie. Should anything more than that be expected of it?\\n\\n                    4 out of 4 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Yet in it\\'s very simplicity, director Robert Wise has created a tale more timeless and relevant than many other \\'message\\'-driven SF blockbusters that followed.Based on Harry Bates\\' short story, \"Farewell to the Master\", which paints a far less friendly view of our galactic community (Gort, the enforcer robot, is revealed to be the true \\'Master\\' of the story, not Klaatu, thus revealing that machines are controlling the Universe), 20th Century Fox and director Wise quickly butted heads on how the film should be presented. Fox envisioned Spencer Tracy as Klaatu, believing that the legendary star\\'s well-established persona would make the SF elements more \\'understandable\\' to audiences. Wise scoffed at the notion, arguing that no one would ever believe Tracy was an alien, and searched until he found relative newcomer Michael Rennie, a gaunt, sensitive British actor, whom he felt best suited the Christ-like quality Klaatu had to possess (even the name Klaatu adopted to mingle with humans was \\'Carpenter\\'). For earth\\'s greatest scientist (a thinly-disguised Albert Einstein), Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe, which also brought a howl from the studio, as the actor was being investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the midst of their infamous \\'witch hunt\\' and blacklisting of Hollywood\\'s supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice, however, displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to \\'Dr. Zorba\\' on \"Ben Casey\".\\nRounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal (still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper), Hugh Marlowe (fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE), and Billy Gray (who would go on to great success in \"Father Knows Best\"). The true casting coup, however, was finding 7-foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot, Gort. Encased in foam rubber \\'armor\\' and \\'lifts\\', to bring his height to nearly eight feet (he actually wore two different outfits, as the seam was impossible to hide, and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera), Martin, who, Wise acknowledged, was not a physically strong man, would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion (if you watch him carefully, during the film, you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over). The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant, and the actress, who was afraid, justifiably, that she might be dropped!The filming was, by and large, an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew (although Patricia Neal, in later interviews, said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film\\'s famous \\'tag\\' phrase, \"Klaatu Barrada Nikto\", without breaking into giggles). Everyone knew the end result would be special; Michael Rennie, ten years later, would call the role the most \"important\" of his career (NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film, on \"Saturday Night at the Movies\").With it\\'s anti-war stand, the film was the direct counterpart of the year\\'s other \\'classic\\' SF production, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the first of Hollywood\\'s \\'alien invasion\\' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, \\'Mankind\\' is the true monster, toying with nuclear weapons, constantly fighting, and willing to kill a peaceful emissary, without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. \"Man must grow up, or be destroyed\" was a powerful message, in 1951, particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery, with it\\'s thousands of headstones, as Klaatu/Carpenter viewed, sadly, the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant, today, which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.\\n\\n                    139 out of 157 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I hope to god this doesn't spawn several Internet themed movies, in the same way 'found movies' did. Haven't we got enough social media in the world, without making movies about it? I suspect this will appeal to the younger person, but it just didn't do it for me. I feel this movie has missed the boat somewhat.....we've already had the ice-bucket challenge, cinnamon challenge, drinking challenges etc etc etc... I agree totally that some clown will try to invent something like this and there will always be bigger clowns who will try to compensate for their lack of a brain by morphing into a sheep and BAAAA copying it.

            "I saw \"Blade Runner\" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the \"Director's Cut\" or \"Final Cut\", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.\"Blade Runner\" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be \"retired\" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is \"Los Angeles, November, 2019\". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little \"action\", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like \"Blade Runner\" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED. If you have a chance to see \"Blade Runner\" in the theater, run, do not walk! It makes for an unforgettable movie theater experience.\n",

              " '\\nThis science fiction classic is more relevant than ever, and I don\\'t mean its silly message about peace. Yes, yes, we\\'re all violent, silly, war-like humans, and we should all throw away our guns and atomic bombs posthaste if we know what\\'s good for us. Thanks, Klaatu. We\\'ll get right on that. Meanwhile, we\\'ll enjoy the chance to watch your story on DVD because we live in an age \\x96 yes, of war and cruelty and weapons of mass destruction \\x96 but also of Jar Jar Binks and \"Alien vs. Predator.\"Klaatu (Michael Rennie) is a gentlemanly outer-space alien who comes to earth in his flying saucer to send us Earthlings a very important message. Sadly, we shoot him on arrival and try to imprison him in a hospital room. He escapes, however, and goes out among us to find the basis for our \"strange, unreasoning attitudes.\" He takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets the widowed Mrs. Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son (Billy Gray). The widow is being romanced by an insurance salesman (Hugh Marlowe), who later displays a lust for glory that endangers Klaatu \\x96 and thus the rest of the world. Klaatu is in better hands when he reveals himself to Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), a brilliant scientist and the best hope for the survival of Earth.It\\'s funny, but I never think about this movie in terms of that plot outline. To me, this film is composed of small moments about people \\x96 especially Mrs. Benson. Mention \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" to me, and the first thing I think about is that moment where the strange new boarder tells her that he\\'d like to spend the day with her son. She hesitates a moment and says in a lowered voice, \"Well, that\\'s awfully nice of you to suggest it.\" It\\'s a tiny moment about her concern for her son, her good manners and her intelligent ability to reply quickly and diplomatically. Patricia Neal, not Gort the robot, makes this movie come alive for me.The real reason this story is so fresh is because \\x96 it\\'s a good story. It\\'s not an excuse to slap us senseless with fast-paced cutting or drown us in great globs of special effects. It has an engaging plot with warm, interesting characters. If we stupidly (and as you know, Klaatu, we humans can be so very stupid) limit ourselves to the New Releases section of the video store, we forget that some sci-fi thrillers put story before special effects.The trick work in this movie is excellent, though. I think the robot looks silly, but when Gort opens its visor and we hear that unnerving theremin music, we don\\'t care that this supposedly metallic creature bends like Styrofoam at the knees. We know those laser beams eyes are about to scorch everything in their sight.Michael Rennie makes up for Gort\\'s deficiencies. He gives what easily could have been a humorless, sanctimonious character a quiet, graceful authority. His slightly otherworldly looks add to the illusion; and Neal as Mrs. Benson completes it by reacting to him with obvious respect \\x96 even when she fears him.Under Robert Wise\\'s direction, every shot is strikingly composed and brings out the maximum dramatic potential of the story. The sense of rhythm and pacing is beautifully suspenseful. Bernard Herrmann, with the theremin as one of his instruments, gives the movie both a nervous tension and a sense of wonder. And the story is so perfectly constructed that it even gets away with a big speech for a climax.What\\'s the heart of this movie? There\\'s a bravura sequence where Billy Gray secretly follows Rennie from the boarding house to his spaceship.

              " '\\nI remember several years ago in my film appreciation class, we were learning about the 50\\'s, our professor had mentioned how many sci-fi films were made with Russian villain undertones as well as the cold war. We watched some of The Day the Earth Stood Still and this film just jumped at me, it was so different than any other film I had seen. I thought it was going to be so cheesy and lame since it was a 50\\'s film, but after watching a little bit of it, I didn\\'t realize the strong message it held. I remember in Terminator 2 there was a line that I still hold true to this day \"It\\'s in your nature to destroy yourselves\", that maybe it\\'s not all technology that will destroy us, but we are our own worst enemies. The Day the Earth Stood was before The Terminator, just like Metropolis was before this film, but these are the best stories and it\\'s like watching a history lesson on film about the time and feel of the 50\\'s.An alien spaceship has landed in Washington, D.C., but it\\'s not what you think with the \"take us to your leader\" type of thing, rather a human like alien comes out offering input on what is going on in the universe, but he is immediately attacked by the humans and taken hostage. His name is Klaatu, he tries to explain several times that he\\'s not here to hurt anyone, but the humans don\\'t trust him. He escapes and goes to a family, since no one knows what he looks like, they think that he\\'s a regular man who just needs a place to stay. He stays with a family and they show him around, they think he\\'s a little strange but very polite and nice, but when they learn of his true identity, he tells them of what his intentions are to mearly warn Planet Earth of it\\'s impending doom.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a true classic, I know there are a lot of young people who complain about the ending, how it\\'s so anti-climatic, but I feel that it\\'s a perfect film and I am so ticked off that it\\'s being re-made. But I guess we will have to see what the film will be like, who knows? It might be good... yeah, right, sorry, was just trying to be nice. But I highly recommend you watch this movie, it\\'s a true classic that has a strong message, has great actors, and fun effects. It\\'s fun to watch these films, I wonder if they realized while making this film back in 1951 that they were acting out their own culture and history.10/10\\n\\n                    106 out of 123 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " \"\\nThis was one of the first sci-fi movies I ever saw and one by which I gage all others. Before there was 'Star Wars' there was 'The Day The Earth Stood Still'. It brought together all that later sci-fi movies strive for. A solid story, believable characters and, for the day, great special FX. It was an examination of society at the time and the racial prejudice that permeated all levels of life. It studies mans fear of the unknown and the violent reaction it produces even today, and how the love of one person can change the course of events for the better. It's a movie that can still stand on its own even by today's standards and should never be remade.But that's just my opinion.\\n\\n                    159 out of 200 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " '\\nInteresting both in itself and as a reflection of its era, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" may seem unspectacular now to those who are used to the extravagant science fiction pictures of the present time, but it deserves its place as a cinema classic. The story is worthwhile in itself, and as soon as you set aside any preconceptions about what science fiction should involve, it also builds up some pretty good drama and suspense. Its perspective is also interesting to see as a reflection of the concerns of its era, which have such obvious similarities with those of the present.The story itself sometimes moves rather slowly, and the focus is really more on the reactions to Klaatu\\'s arrival than on the action itself. As Klaatu, Michael Rennie stays pretty low-key, as does the rest of the cast much of the time. Although there are times when the movie might lack some energy as a result, in general it probably works better that way than it would have if there were too much forced emphasis on the urgency of Klaatu\\'s mission, which is more than able to speak for itself. The ideas behind the story are fairly simple, but they are, of course, just as significant now (or in practically any other era) as they were in the 1950\\'s.\\n\\n                    52 out of 63 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " \"\\nA flying saucer lands in Washington, and a man, Klaatu (Michael Rennie), brings the preoccupation of other planets with the use of atomic energy and development of spacecraft by people on Earth planet. Further, he brings a message and also a threaten against the danger Earth could cause to other planets: the planet could be destroyed if the people does not live in peace. Any menace to other planets would cause the destruction of the entire planet. This classic is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. The story is very simple, but the message is wonderful. When this film was made, World War II had finished six years ago only, there was the Cold War and the paranoia of the Americans at that time was against the communists. The special effects are excellent for a 1951 movie. In Brazil, this classic movie was not released on VHS or DVD. It is a shame! I have a VHS, having a version dubbed in Portuguese, full of commercial and with a terrible quality of image that I recorded from TV many years ago.

              " '\\nIt\\'s odd to think that fifty years from now there may only be a handful of movies released in 2004 that will be remembered at all. I don\\'t care to venture any guesses as to what they may be, but it\\'s easy to see why The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the ones from 1951 that remains a classic, while so many others sank into obscurity. The movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples\\' minds in the early 1950s, in America and the rest of the world, and that is the conflicts between many different nations, and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other. It was released at the time of the Red Scare and so soon after World War II that international tensions were still high. Also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title, why, it\\'s not very frightening at all!Okay, that made no sense, but I couldn\\'t resist. My respect for the movie dimmed sharply when I saw that the alien was not only a man, but a good looking man who spoke perfect English, but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years. Unlikely, but it\\'s an explanation, which is more than most science fiction films provide. Granted, not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction, but in this case something had to be said. The alien didn\\'t give may details as to his physical condition, but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human, he must have a similar environment to our own on his planet.Speaking of which, there is one thing about the science that I\\'m also curious about. At what stage were astronomical studies in the early 1950s? I\\'m wondering how far into space scientists were looking, because Carpenter, the alien, states with some grandeur that he has traveled 250 million miles to get to earth, which in astronomical terms is a tiny, tiny distance. Considering that the sun is 93 million miles from earth, this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system. And here\\'s another little factoid \\x96 Earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year, as you know. Pluto, on the other hand, takes something like 248 years to revolve around the sun. That has nothing to do with the movie, but is an interesting digression, I should think.I found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie, and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time. It was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations, and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda (oxymoron intended). I actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument has.When Carpenter (who they stopped just short of simply naming Jesus) was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations, he was genuinely surprised and saddened. He gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the Earth\\'s atmosphere and, since humans clearly are unable to get along, he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration. Most importantly, if we chose the latter, they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space. The descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing, it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one another.This is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that Jonathan Swift presented in Utopia, his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted. They have created robots, which we seen in the Iron Man, to prevent the rise of violence in their society. The robots have tremendous power, which cannot be revoked, and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor, which results in a peaceful society. I\\'m also reminded of Gulliver\\'s Travels, also by Jonathan Swift, particularly the section where Gulliver lives among the Houynymns which, interestingly enough, are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace. When at one point Gulliver describes lying, which does not exist to the Houynymns, one of them responds incredulously with something like, \"Why on Earth would one say something that isn\\'t so?\" Carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings, which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy, maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own world.The famous quote that I\\'ve quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents, and Evil Dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that Ash had such a hard time speaking in Army of Darkness. The genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones, and I think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world, as The Day the Earth Stood Still obviously does. Given the political atmosphere here in the first month of 2005, it\\'s obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie, but then again, as Arnold stated in Terminator 2, \"It\\'s in your nature to destroy yourselves.\"Scary.\\n\\n                    126 out of 188 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Sure, some of the acting and stuff may look a little hokey to jaded modern audiences... but this movie is still extremely well-done... like a movie-length episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" (one of the better ones). A spaceship lands in Washington and a traveler steps forth... before he even has a chance to get a word out, the US Army takes a shot at him... causing his robot companion to destroy some military hardware. The alien, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) tries to reason with the US government but, of course, gets nowhere. So he escapes and travels among humankind to try and get a handle on why people are so suspicious and untrusting. He gets a room in a boarding house and makes friends with a pretty widow (Patricia Neal) and her young son. Mankind has just come upon the means of using atomic energy as a weapon and Klaatu is here to make sure that humans won\\'t pose a threat to other worlds... or else! Well-written, suspenseful and thought-provoking... even today!

              " \"\\nOK. Maybe that's dramatic, but it's true. I'm not nearly as old as this film and the first time I saw it, I was a young child and impressionable as only young children are. I can honestly say that every alien encounter I've experienced through movies, t.v. shows and literature has been measured against The Day The Earth Stood Still, and most have come up short. I credit the film's depiction of human/alien interactions with my present-day feelings about how people should treat each other - within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders. I think the movie made the young girl I was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come, and in those years I would have become a different person. The effect was deeply profound, and remains so even 30 years after my first screening. That said, it is still entertaining, a joy to revisit. There are no expensive, hi-tech special effects that look great in teasers, but do nothing for the plot. It's very straight forward, honest, pure. It's emotional and intellectual instead of the typical shoot-em-up space battle films that are today's norm. And while I enjoy a good explosion now and then, the change of pace is refreshing.\\n\\n                    14 out of 17 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Klaatu does not care if we kill each other, but cannot tolerate what atomic bombs can do to the other planets.

When Klaatu mentions, 'levelling New York', I got a chill.  One or two moments were slightly puzzling - why does Klaatu allow himself to be interviewed on television, when he knows he is being tracked down?  Why is he being pursued at the end so vigorously when he was scheduled to address the world?  And why did Patricia Neal have to be brought onto the spaceship at the end?

              " '\\nA great Sci Fi flick from 1951 that carries a very deep message. Granted the props are hokie compared to today\\'s standard, and the space suits pretty amateurish, but the script is excellent, and the theme contemporary.  \\nI am not a religious nut, nor do I prescribe to the fundamentalist assault on our civil liberties, but this movie certainly carries a theocratic religious message which should be universally accepted. War and fighting among earth\\'s nations will surely cause havoc among the planets of the universe and man must stop its mad race to destruction or leaders of the universe will do it for you.Michael Rennie plays the role of a messenger from another world who gently, and with humbleness, attempts to convince the scientists of the world they must become active to carry the message to the world leaders of impending doom unless they change world policy on armament and war. The character portrayed by Rennie is tall, gentle, intelligent, soothing, yet firm.  Who does he represent? Why Christ of course.His speech, nature, demeanor, and message are all symbolic of a greater power coming back to earth to warn the people what might befall them unless they change their mad march toward destruction.  This character is named appropriately,  Mr. \"Carpenter\" (get the message) and even gets killed by soldiers bent on destroying this evil force from outer space.  Mr Carpenter will even rise from the dead with assistance from his beloved robot assistant.  A great movie that will only get more popular with age.

              " \"\\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still is directed by Robert Wise and adapted to screenplay by Edmund H. North from the story Farewell to the Master written by Harry Bates. It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray and Frances Bavier. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Leo Tover. Classic sci-fi is right here as director Robert Wise gives a beautifully steady hand to Harry Bate's short story. Peace for the world or else is the message and I don't see anything wrong with that because it stands up to relevant scrutiny today and unfortunately many days ahead in the future. Debates about the allegorical worth of the film still persist today, but the core message is not up for argument. Wise shows his influences from the time when he worked with Orson Welles and Val Lewton, where here, aided by Tover's beautiful photography, he blends the feel of semi-documentary starkness with film noir visuality. Whether it's scenes of Klaatu (Rennie) trawling the wet night streets, or the interiors of the spaceship and boarding house, the visual imagery by way of low-key lighting compositions is often striking for mood accentuation. All the cast are spot on in their respective performances, with Neal refreshingly given a female role that doesn't resort to her being token sex appeal or a shrieking harpy. Herrmann's understated score is dynamite, and pretty much imitated wholesale from this point onwards, and the film is laced with poignant and frightening scenes that keep the viewer firmly glued to the tale unfolding. The demonstration of the visitors power gives the film its title and it's a glorious slice of celluloid, and in Gort the robot (Lock Martin) we have one of the biggest icons in sci-fi cinema. Once viewed one can never forget The Day The Earth Stood Still, its message, its structured precision and its technical smarts ensure you will remember this film always. One of the most important science fiction movies of all time, a game changer in the critical year for the sci-fi genre. All told it's magic cinema still standing the test of time. 10/10\\n\\n                    13 out of 17 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " \"\\nWhen a space ship lands in the middle of a playing field in Washington, the military respond with an immediate shut down of the area.  The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift, but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon.  Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons.  The alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders.  When he is refused, he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito.  The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950's sci-fi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture \\x96 the score alone has been aped (or lifted in the Simpson's case) in many other films.  The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends, rather than a `beware the red menace' message of fear and hate.  In fact one character even says she thinks the `alien' is from earth (ie Russia) only to be hushed!  The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu's warning of `disarm or we'll remove your threat by destroying you' in the same light. Isn't this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently? I'll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu's pre-emptive strike, while holding a critical view of Bush's.That aside the film's production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect \\x96 the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious, but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking (sorry \\x96 accidental pun) at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wide-eyed all American boy (Bobby, but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy) to see the whole thing, but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism, but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu's threat of a pre-emptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.\\n\\n                    15 out of 22 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

And, I didn\\'t really know anything about it when the DVD of the restored film came out recently. But I bought my own copy anyway for two reasons - first it seems like a great addition to my DVD collection and second, it was only $9.99 which is quite a bargain. I watched it today, and I am not disappointed. It is historical, it has a good script with good acting, and it is the kind of movie that you can notice different things each time you view it. The black and white image is superb, with hardly any defects, and it has interesting extras, including a special THX Optimode extra which allows you to adjust your TV for the best B&W picture.some SPOILERS follow, please don\\'t read any further if you have not seen the movie yet and want to be totally surprised.Klaatu and his robot arrive in a flying saucer and land on the Washington, DC mall. He comes out, announces that he comes in peace, and is promptly shot by a nervous military man. He looks mid-30s, is actually 78 years old, and his wound heals in a day, obviously from an advanced race some 250 million miles away. His planet has been monitoring Earth, they are a peaceful people who built robots to monitor them and destroy any signs of aggression. They sent Klaatu to Earth to warn us, if we don\\'t solve our multi-nation conflicts, they would destroy Earth. After WW II and the atomic bomb, they have become concerned that an Earth nation would eventually threaten their civilization and peace.Of course there had to be a demonstration that Klaatu and his robot could really do this, so he did this at noon the next day, all over the Earth electricity was \"neutralized\" for exactly one half hour. Even batteries did not work, so cars and motorcycles or lawnmowers wouldn\\'t run, no phone, elevators, assembly line, etc. All except planes in the air and hospitals.To appreciate this film you have to realize WW II with the atomic bomb had ended only a few years earlier. The \"cold war\" was in full swing, with world-wide fear of the spread of Communism. So this was really a film with a message, to make a statement, that our nations need to figure out a way to live in peace or our Earth may be destroyed.It is curious watching the film\\'s message today, only a month after President Bush gave Saddam Hussein of Iraq essentially the same message that Klaatu gave in the movie - disarm or we\\'ll destroy you.  That\\'s the most eerie part of this movie.\\n\\n                    9 out of 12 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " \"\\nThis is one of the best science fiction movies ever made, bar none, and its message is still pertinent over 50 years later. This movie is my all-time favorite film of any genre, and no other science fiction movie has ever moved me like this one has. It is intelligently written, it's premise is unique for the early 50's..that an alien is benevolent and more evolved socially and technically and is not 'the monster of the week' or out to harm us..and the casting of Michael Rennie in the role of Klaatu was inspired. With his tall, thin, angular look, he looks as if he might be from another world, yet he is handsome as well to make him appealing. His accent, too, makes him seem just a bit different. All in all, I have never been affected so deeply by a movie in my life, and it was (fittingly) the first VHS movie I ever bought back in 1979. Today, I have the DVD version as well. I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough, both for the quality of the production and story and for the message of international peace and cooperation which is still relevant today. We have not learned a great deal about getting along with each other in the more than 50 years since this film was released, and it still packs a punch.\\n\\n                    7 out of 9 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " '\\nI\\'ll start this review saying that while many people won\\'t recognize his name, director Robert Wise was probably among the most creative directors of history, and among the most important; with a resume that includes not only this 50s classic, but also The Body Snatcher (1945), West Side Story (1961), The Sound of Music (1965) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979); his legacy is highly influential and surely will last forever.With that said, let\\'s start with \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", a movie that quickly gained a place among the classics of the Sci-Fi genre. The plot is very simple, but it is the way it is developed what is very moving, thought-provoking and also, quite scary. On a normal day, an alien space ship lands on Washington creating panic, when the mysterious visitor appears, he is suddenly attacked by the army. Surviving the attack, the alien explains that his purposes are pacific, and that he has an important message for the world. The U.S. government, immersed in its international intrigues, wants to have the message for themselves, but the alien, Klaatu(Michael Rennie) won\\'t give it to them only, as it is a message important for all the creatures on earth.The movie works at many levels, but at its core, it is an anti-war movie. Written in protest against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, it reflects the fears of the society in the 50s and the fear of nuclear holocaust. While Klaatu\\'s ultimate solution may seem like a bigger threat, it was indeed toned down, since in the source story it was the robot, Gort, who was the real master. It is a powerful message, and it is handled perfectly by Wise, in scenes when Klaatu in disguise, explores human nature guided by a boy.Unlike most of the sci-Fi movies, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" has not dated badly, in fact, its message remains as powerful and valid as the day it was released. The wars, the intrigues and complexities of our society make almost impossible the dream of world peace, and Klaatu\\'s perfect society seems unreachable for us.The superb work of Robert Wise would not be the same if it wasn\\'t for his SFX team, who did amazing things with very little. Also, the cast is superb, and while the dialogs may sound corny now, it is a very good script. Sure, it may have its share of plot holes, but the movie carries the message well and the overall product is near perfect.The acting is a bit typical of the 50s, nevertheless, it is worth to mention the superb performances of Michael Rennie as Klaatu, Sam Jaffe as the lead scientist and Billy Gray as the kid, Bobby Benson, who shows Klaatu the human world.The movie makes many points, and has various interpretations, from religious allegory to political critic, the story is timeless indeed. Many words could be written about this movie as it is one classic of cinema history that must be seen at least once in a life time. While we are probably too far from Klaatu\\'s perfect world, and the fear of a ultimate war is still present, we can hope that one day peace will be achieved.10/10. Magnificent.\\n\\n                    9 out of 13 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " \"\\nMany of the old black-and-white science-fiction classics are often remembered for a particularly grand element they have to them. Sometimes, it's for their groundbreaking special effects, like the original King Kong (1933) or The War of the Worlds (1953). Sometimes it's because they have a particularly interesting character or villain like Frankenstein (1931) and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). And sometimes it's because they feature a creature that absolutely frightens or haunts you like Count Orlok in Nosferatu (1922). But there's only a handful of classics out there that get their recognition because of a moral message they carry. One such example is the original, Japanese version of Godzilla (1954). Another is the 1951 revolutionary classic The Day the Earth Stood Still.This memorable motion picture, recently remade with Keanu Reeves, and based on a story by Harry Bates, tells the fictional tale of an event in history when a flying saucer landed in Washington D.C. Two extra terrestrial beings emerged from its mysterious form. A humanlike messenger named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and an eight-foot-tall, invulnerable robot called Gort (Lock Martin). These two beings arrive upon the era where mankind had began to strongly develop atomic energy and increase the violent and catastrophic potential of its warfare. The extra terrestrials arrive with a warning for all of mankind. By harnessing such horrible power and using it to create weapons, mankind was creating an intergalactic threat as well as endangering its own existence on Earth. Klaatu's warning was simple: cut off the production of nuclear weapons and live in peace, or be destroyed as a threat to other worlds in the universe.Like many other popular science-fiction films, The Day the Earth Stood Still features impressive visual effects. Even the robot, Gort, which is nothing more than a man in a flexible costume, looks like a machine made from foreign-world material. The scenes where the UFO lands in Washington D.C. and where a death ray sprays into a tank and dissolves it in a flash of white light still spellbind to this day. But its more notable elements were created by the characters and by the screenwriters.The extra-terrestrial, Klaatu looks remarkably human. He doesn't have antenna, or three eyes, or tentacles, and his physical form is not a disguise. Oddly enough, this is more convincing than the present standards for aliens, which have to look like animals, particularly invertebrates, to be believable. And because he looks human, Klaatu is more relatable as a being instead of a creature. And he has morals, again, relatable and more compelling a buggy-eyed, other-planet nihilist bent on enslavement and destruction. And besides, they way I see it, if there are other beings out in the world, they wouldn't be much different than us. Physically or morally.Another noteworthy element is its symbolism, which like Godzilla (1954) stands out against nuclear war and the destruction of the environment. While it does not carry its message as vividly and horrifyingly, director Robert Wise wisely influences this message several times to keep it fresh in our minds. And while a movie cannot change the world, it is comforting to know that there were, and still are good people who realize these nightmarish elements of our world and feel compelled enough to communicate a message to us.The Day the Earth Stood Still has aged a bit since its debut in 1951, but this does in no way, take away from its influence. It has deservedly earned his place in the long list of classics from the age when true motion pictures were made instead of the standard, hackneyed projects that seem to attract audience members today in the 21st century.\\n\\n                    10 out of 15 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " '\\n\"There must be security for all or no one is secure.\"- Klaatu, to the world\\'s leaders at the conclusion of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can\\'t fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North\\'s fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man\\'s capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie\\'s urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don\\'t waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).\\n\\n                    6 out of 8 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              " '\\nAfter WWII and the invention of the atomic bomb, people in the 50\\'s were looking for strong leaders who could command moral authority. Enter General Eisenhower, who would become a two-term U.S. President; \"Father Knows Best\", with its stern but loving father figure; and the iron-fisted biblical epic: \"The Ten Commandments\".Enter, too, \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\", a 1951 sci-fi classic soaked in images of authority ... the police, the military, and the tall, stern, Moses-like figure from another world, Klaatu, who lectures us on the folly of nuclear war. It is, I believe, this pacifist message emanating from strength that explains the film\\'s enduring popularity.Noble as the message is, what about its cinematic vehicle? Visually and musically, the film is appropriately frigid and forbidding. Leo Tover\\'s noirish B&W lighting and unobtrusive camera work, combined with Bernard Herrmann\\'s score and the eerie theramin sounds all work in concert to convey a mood of Orwellian severity and other worldly coldness.But the script is disappointing. This is a very talky film, which dilutes its effectiveness as sci-fi. The dialogue seems stodgy, canned, uninspired. Example: \"attention zone 5, attention zone 5, yellow cab moving north ... man and woman in backseat; get license number and report ... deploy all units according to Plan B immediately\" (well, at least it was not Plan 9...).This pedestrian script could have been borrowed from most any cops and robbers flick of the 40\\'s. On the other hand, I guess I can forgive the script\\'s moratorium on humor, given the seriousness of the message.The film\\'s science is very dated, thus requiring further tolerance. Klaatu to scientists: \"The universe grows smaller every day\"; no, actually the physical universe is expanding. \"Venus and Mars ... are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it\"; no, not with their temperature extremes and chemical composition.And the special effects are curiously minimal in the same era that produced the beautifully weird gliding machines from Mars in \"War Of The Worlds\" (1953), and the lurking terror in \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956).One solid accomplishment of this film is its accurate portrayal of society in the early 1950\\'s: the old cars, men\\'s formal attire (especially those hats), interior decor, antiquated TV sets, and of course the confidence in institutional authority.In summary then, the movie, for me, functions less as a credible sci-fi vehicle than as a fascinating socio-political commentary on American life in the early 1950\\'s.\\n\\n                    43 out of 85 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

              "'\\nTHE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is such a basic Science Fiction story that many first-time viewers have been stunned by the reverence in which it is held. An alien arrives on earth, is misunderstood and is nearly killed, passes a warning to mankind to not carry the weapons of potential nuclear war into space, or face annihilation, then leaves. The FX are minimal, there are no \\'space battles\\' or \\'monsters\\', even the score, by the legendary composer Bernard Herrmann, is simple, lacking the bombast of later \\'epics\\'. Yet in it\\'s very simplicity, director Robert Wise has created a tale more timeless and relevant than many other \\'message\\'-driven SF blockbusters that followed.Based on Harry Bates\\' short story, \"Farewell to the Master\", which paints a far less friendly view of our galactic community (Gort, the enforcer robot, is revealed to be the true \\'Master\\' of the story, not Klaatu, thus revealing that machines are controlling the Universe), 20th Century Fox and director Wise quickly butted heads on how the film should be presented. Fox envisioned Spencer Tracy as Klaatu, believing that the legendary star\\'s well-established persona would make the SF elements more \\'understandable\\' to audiences. Wise scoffed at the notion, arguing that no one would ever believe Tracy was an alien, and searched until he found relative newcomer Michael Rennie, a gaunt, sensitive British actor, whom he felt best suited the Christ-like quality Klaatu had to possess (even the name Klaatu adopted to mingle with humans was \\'Carpenter\\'). For earth\\'s greatest scientist (a thinly-disguised Albert Einstein), Wise cast screen veteran Sam Jaffe, which also brought a howl from the studio, as the actor was being investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the midst of their infamous \\'witch hunt\\' and blacklisting of Hollywood\\'s supposed Communist sympathizers. Jaffe proved a perfect choice, however, displaying many of the qualities he would later bring to \\'Dr. Zorba\\' on \"Ben Casey\".\\nRounding out the cast were popular actress Patricia Neal (still recovering from her failed relationship with Gary Cooper), Hugh Marlowe (fresh from the success of ALL ABOUT EVE), and Billy Gray (who would go on to great success in \"Father Knows Best\"). The true casting coup, however, was finding 7-foot Hollywood doorman Lock Martin to portray the robot, Gort. Encased in foam rubber \\'armor\\' and \\'lifts\\', to bring his height to nearly eight feet (he actually wore two different outfits, as the seam was impossible to hide, and would always have to be on the opposite side to the camera), Martin, who, Wise acknowledged, was not a physically strong man, would occasionally faint from heat exhaustion (if you watch him carefully, during the film, you can actually see moments when he would start to tilt over). The scene where he carries Neal on board the spacecraft was a major achievement for the easily tired giant, and the actress, who was afraid, justifiably, that she might be dropped!The filming was, by and large, an enjoyable experience for the cast and crew (although Patricia Neal, in later interviews, said that it was nearly impossible for her to say the film\\'s famous \\'tag\\' phrase, \"Klaatu Barrada Nikto\", without breaking into giggles). Everyone knew the end result would be special; Michael Rennie, ten years later, would call the role the most \"important\" of his career (NBC would even bring him in to host the network premiere of the film, on \"Saturday Night at the Movies\").With it\\'s anti-war stand, the film was the direct counterpart of the year\\'s other \\'classic\\' SF production, THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the first of Hollywood\\'s \\'alien invasion\\' films. In THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, \\'Mankind\\' is the true monster, toying with nuclear weapons, constantly fighting, and willing to kill a peaceful emissary, without allowing him to deliver his message or offer his gifts to the world. \"Man must grow up, or be destroyed\" was a powerful message, in 1951, particularly when Wise panned his camera over Arlington Cemetery, with it\\'s thousands of headstones, as Klaatu/Carpenter viewed, sadly, the end result of our fixation with warfare.The message is even more relevant, today, which is why THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remains a classic.\\n\\n                    139 out of 157 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Yes, yes, we\\'re all violent, silly, war-like humans, and we should all throw away our guns and atomic bombs posthaste if we know what\\'s good for us. Thanks, Klaatu. We\\'ll get right on that. Meanwhile, we\\'ll enjoy the chance to watch your story on DVD because we live in an age \\x96 yes, of war and cruelty and weapons of mass destruction \\x96 but also of Jar Jar Binks and \"Alien vs. Predator.\"Klaatu (Michael Rennie) is a gentlemanly outer-space alien who comes to earth in his flying saucer to send us Earthlings a very important message. Sadly, we shoot him on arrival and try to imprison him in a hospital room. He escapes, however, and goes out among us to find the basis for our \"strange, unreasoning attitudes.\" He takes a room in a boarding house, where he meets the widowed Mrs. Benson (Patricia Neal) and her young son (Billy Gray). The widow is being romanced by an insurance salesman (Hugh Marlowe), who later displays a lust for glory that endangers Klaatu \\x96 and thus the rest of the world. Klaatu is in better hands when he reveals himself to Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), a brilliant scientist and the best hope for the survival of Earth.It\\'s funny, but I never think about this movie in terms of that plot outline. To me, this film is composed of small moments about people \\x96 especially Mrs. Benson. Mention \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" to me, and the first thing I think about is that moment where the strange new boarder tells her that he\\'d like to spend the day with her son. She hesitates a moment and says in a lowered voice, \"Well, that\\'s awfully nice of you to suggest it.\" It\\'s a tiny moment about her concern for her son, her good manners and her intelligent ability to reply quickly and diplomatically. Patricia Neal, not Gort the robot, makes this movie come alive for me.The real reason this story is so fresh is because \\x96 it\\'s a good story. It\\'s not an excuse to slap us senseless with fast-paced cutting or drown us in great globs of special effects. It has an engaging plot with warm, interesting characters. If we stupidly (and as you know, Klaatu, we humans can be so very stupid) limit ourselves to the New Releases section of the video store, we forget that some sci-fi thrillers put story before special effects.The trick work in this movie is excellent, though. I think the robot looks silly, but when Gort opens its visor and we hear that unnerving theremin music, we don\\'t care that this supposedly metallic creature bends like Styrofoam at the knees. We know those laser beams eyes are about to scorch everything in their sight.Michael Rennie makes up for Gort\\'s deficiencies. He gives what easily could have been a humorless, sanctimonious character a quiet, graceful authority. His slightly otherworldly looks add to the illusion; and Neal as Mrs. Benson completes it by reacting to him with obvious respect \\x96 even when she fears him.Under Robert Wise\\'s direction, every shot is strikingly composed and brings out the maximum dramatic potential of the story. The sense of rhythm and pacing is beautifully suspenseful. Bernard Herrmann, with the theremin as one of his instruments, gives the movie both a nervous tension and a sense of wonder. And the story is so perfectly constructed that it even gets away with a big speech for a climax.What\\'s the heart of this movie? There\\'s a bravura sequence where Billy Gray secretly follows Rennie from the boarding house to his spaceship. It\\'s a simple, wordless scene where the entire team of filmmakers \\x96 and that goes double for Herrmann \\x96 meld the ordinary and the fantastic. You want a special effect? That\\'s it.\\n\\n                    202 out of 237 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

We watched some of The Day the Earth Stood Still and this film just jumped at me, it was so different than any other film I had seen. I thought it was going to be so cheesy and lame since it was a 50\\'s film, but after watching a little bit of it, I didn\\'t realize the strong message it held. I remember in Terminator 2 there was a line that I still hold true to this day \"It\\'s in your nature to destroy yourselves\", that maybe it\\'s not all technology that will destroy us, but we are our own worst enemies. The Day the Earth Stood was before The Terminator, just like Metropolis was before this film, but these are the best stories and it\\'s like watching a history lesson on film about the time and feel of the 50\\'s.An alien spaceship has landed in Washington, D.C., but it\\'s not what you think with the \"take us to your leader\" type of thing, rather a human like alien comes out offering input on what is going on in the universe, but he is immediately attacked by the humans and taken hostage. His name is Klaatu, he tries to explain several times that he\\'s not here to hurt anyone, but the humans don\\'t trust him. He escapes and goes to a family, since no one knows what he looks like, they think that he\\'s a regular man who just needs a place to stay. He stays with a family and they show him around, they think he\\'s a little strange but very polite and nice, but when they learn of his true identity, he tells them of what his intentions are to mearly warn Planet Earth of it\\'s impending doom.The Day the Earth Stood Still is a true classic, I know there are a lot of young people who complain about the ending, how it\\'s so anti-climatic, but I feel that it\\'s a perfect film and I am so ticked off that it\\'s being re-made. But I guess we will have to see what the film will be like, who knows? It might be good... yeah, right, sorry, was just trying to be nice. But I highly recommend you watch this movie, it\\'s a true classic that has a strong message, has great actors, and fun effects. It\\'s fun to watch these films, I wonder if they realized while making this film back in 1951 that they were acting out their own culture and history.10/10\\n\\n                    106 out of 123 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The story is worthwhile in itself, and as soon as you set aside any preconceptions about what science fiction should involve, it also builds up some pretty good drama and suspense. Its perspective is also interesting to see as a reflection of the concerns of its era, which have such obvious similarities with those of the present.The story itself sometimes moves rather slowly, and the focus is really more on the reactions to Klaatu\\'s arrival than on the action itself. As Klaatu, Michael Rennie stays pretty low-key, as does the rest of the cast much of the time. Although there are times when the movie might lack some energy as a result, in general it probably works better that way than it would have if there were too much forced emphasis on the urgency of Klaatu\\'s mission, which is more than able to speak for itself. The ideas behind the story are fairly simple, but they are, of course, just as significant now (or in practically any other era) as they were in the 1950\\'s.\\n\\n                    52 out of 63 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Further, he brings a message and also a threaten against the danger Earth could cause to other planets: the planet could be destroyed if the people does not live in peace. Any menace to other planets would cause the destruction of the entire planet. This classic is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. The story is very simple, but the message is wonderful. When this film was made, World War II had finished six years ago only, there was the Cold War and the paranoia of the Americans at that time was against the communists. The special effects are excellent for a 1951 movie. In Brazil, this classic movie was not released on VHS or DVD. It is a shame! I have a VHS, having a version dubbed in Portuguese, full of commercial and with a terrible quality of image that I recorded from TV many years ago.

I don\\'t care to venture any guesses as to what they may be, but it\\'s easy to see why The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the ones from 1951 that remains a classic, while so many others sank into obscurity. The movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples\\' minds in the early 1950s, in America and the rest of the world, and that is the conflicts between many different nations, and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other. It was released at the time of the Red Scare and so soon after World War II that international tensions were still high. Also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title, why, it\\'s not very frightening at all!Okay, that made no sense, but I couldn\\'t resist. My respect for the movie dimmed sharply when I saw that the alien was not only a man, but a good looking man who spoke perfect English, but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years. Unlikely, but it\\'s an explanation, which is more than most science fiction films provide. Granted, not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction, but in this case something had to be said. The alien didn\\'t give may details as to his physical condition, but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human, he must have a similar environment to our own on his planet.Speaking of which, there is one thing about the science that I\\'m also curious about. At what stage were astronomical studies in the early 1950s? I\\'m wondering how far into space scientists were looking, because Carpenter, the alien, states with some grandeur that he has traveled 250 million miles to get to earth, which in astronomical terms is a tiny, tiny distance. Considering that the sun is 93 million miles from earth, this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system. And here\\'s another little factoid \\x96 Earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year, as you know. Pluto, on the other hand, takes something like 248 years to revolve around the sun. That has nothing to do with the movie, but is an interesting digression, I should think.I found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie, and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time. It was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations, and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda (oxymoron intended). I actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument has.When Carpenter (who they stopped just short of simply naming Jesus) was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations, he was genuinely surprised and saddened. He gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the Earth\\'s atmosphere and, since humans clearly are unable to get along, he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration. Most importantly, if we chose the latter, they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space. The descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing, it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one another.This is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that Jonathan Swift presented in Utopia, his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted. They have created robots, which we seen in the Iron Man, to prevent the rise of violence in their society. The robots have tremendous power, which cannot be revoked, and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor, which results in a peaceful society. I\\'m also reminded of Gulliver\\'s Travels, also by Jonathan Swift, particularly the section where Gulliver lives among the Houynymns which, interestingly enough, are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace. When at one point Gulliver describes lying, which does not exist to the Houynymns, one of them responds incredulously with something like, \"Why on Earth would one say something that isn\\'t so?\" Carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings, which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy, maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own world.The famous quote that I\\'ve quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents, and Evil Dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that Ash had such a hard time speaking in Army of Darkness. The genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones, and I think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world, as The Day the Earth Stood Still obviously does. Given the political atmosphere here in the first month of 2005, it\\'s obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie, but then again, as Arnold stated in Terminator 2, \"It\\'s in your nature to destroy yourselves.\"Scary.\\n\\n                    126 out of 188 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The alien, Klaatu (Michael Rennie) tries to reason with the US government but, of course, gets nowhere. So he escapes and travels among humankind to try and get a handle on why people are so suspicious and untrusting.

I can honestly say that every alien encounter I\\'ve experienced through movies, t.v. shows and literature has been measured against The Day The Earth Stood Still, and most have come up short. I credit the film\\'s depiction of human/alien interactions with my present-day feelings about how people should treat each other - within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders. I think the movie made the young girl I was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come, and in those years I would have become a different person. The effect was deeply profound, and remains so even 30 years after my first screening. That said, it is still entertaining, a joy to revisit. There are no expensive, hi-tech special effects that look great in teasers, but do nothing for the plot. It\\'s very straight forward, honest, pure.

Klaatu does not care if we kill each other, but cannot tolerate what atomic bombs can do to the other planets.  Naturally he is not welcomed with open arms, but in our defense, he was not exactly invited.  The most disturbing part is that this movie is more timely than ever right now.  When Klaatu mentions, \\'levelling New York\\', I got a chill.  One or two moments were slightly puzzling - why does Klaatu allow himself to be interviewed on television, when he knows he is being tracked down?  Why is he being pursued at the end so vigorously when he was scheduled to address the world?  And why did Patricia Neal have to be brought onto the spaceship at the end?

The character portrayed by Rennie is tall, gentle, intelligent, soothing, yet firm.  Who does he represent? Why Christ of course.His speech, nature, demeanor, and message are all symbolic of a greater power coming back to earth to warn the people what might befall them unless they change their mad march toward destruction.  This character is named appropriately,  Mr. \"Carpenter\" (get the message) and even gets killed by soldiers bent on destroying this evil force from outer space.

North from the story Farewell to the Master written by Harry Bates. It stars Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe, Billy Gray and Frances Bavier. Music is by Bernard Herrmann and cinematography by Leo Tover. Classic sci-fi is right here as director Robert Wise gives a beautifully steady hand to Harry Bate\\'s short story. Peace for the world or else is the message and I don\\'t see anything wrong with that because it stands up to relevant scrutiny today and unfortunately many days ahead in the future. Debates about the allegorical worth of the film still persist today, but the core message is not up for argument. Wise shows his influences from the time when he worked with Orson Welles and Val Lewton, where here, aided by Tover\\'s beautiful photography, he blends the feel of semi-documentary starkness with film noir visuality. Whether it\\'s scenes of Klaatu (Rennie) trawling the wet night streets, or the interiors of the spaceship and boarding house, the visual imagery by way of low-key lighting compositions is often striking for mood accentuation. All the cast are spot on in their respective performances, with Neal refreshingly given a female role that doesn\\'t resort to her being token sex appeal or a shrieking harpy. Herrmann\\'s understated score is dynamite, and pretty much imitated wholesale from this point onwards, and the film is laced with poignant and frightening scenes that keep the viewer firmly glued to the tale unfolding. The demonstration of the visitors power gives the film its title and it\\'s a glorious slice of celluloid, and in Gort the robot (Lock Martin) we have one of the biggest icons in sci-fi cinema. Once viewed one can never forget The Day The Earth Stood Still, its message, its structured precision and its technical smarts ensure you will remember this film always. One of the most important science fiction movies of all time, a game changer in the critical year for the sci-fi genre. All told it\\'s magic cinema still standing the test of time. 10/10\\n\\n                    13 out of 17 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

The inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift, but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon.  Seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons.  The alien, Klaatu, is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders.  When he is refused, he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito.  The man hunt starts as Klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disaster.In a sea of 1950\\'s sci-fi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture \\x96 the score alone has been aped (or lifted in the Simpson\\'s case) in many other films.  The plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends, rather than a `beware the red menace\\' message of fear and hate.  In fact one character even says she thinks the `alien\\' is from earth (ie Russia) only to be hushed!  The film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as Klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a whole.In recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at Klaatu\\'s warning of `disarm or we\\'ll remove your threat by destroying you\\' in the same light. Isn\\'t this the same warning and actions that Bush and Blair made recently? I\\'ll leave you with that thought but I found it difficult to understand Klaatu\\'s pre-emptive strike, while holding a critical view of Bush\\'s.That aside the film\\'s production is very polished.  The score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it.  The direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect \\x96 the very idea of the space ship landing in Washington is obvious, but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking (sorry \\x96 accidental pun) at the heart of ordinary America.  The cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre.  Rennie does good work as Klaatu and Neal is more than just a screamer as Helen.  Of course we have to have a wide-eyed all American boy (Bobby, but it could easily be Johnny or Jimmy) to see the whole thing, but he does OK.Overall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences.  The pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism, but the ease with which you now accept Klaatu\\'s threat of a pre-emptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months.\\n\\n                    15 out of 22 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

And, I didn\\'t really know anything about it when the DVD of the restored film came out recently. But I bought my own copy anyway for two reasons - first it seems like a great addition to my DVD collection and second, it was only $9.99 which is quite a bargain. I watched it today, and I am not disappointed. It is historical, it has a good script with good acting, and it is the kind of movie that you can notice different things each time you view it. The black and white image is superb, with hardly any defects, and it has interesting extras, including a special THX Optimode extra which allows you to adjust your TV for the best B&W picture.some SPOILERS follow, please don\\'t read any further if you have not seen the movie yet and want to be totally surprised.Klaatu and his robot arrive in a flying saucer and land on the Washington, DC mall. He comes out, announces that he comes in peace, and is promptly shot by a nervous military man. He looks mid-30s, is actually 78 years old, and his wound heals in a day, obviously from an advanced race some 250 million miles away. His planet has been monitoring Earth, they are a peaceful people who built robots to monitor them and destroy any signs of aggression. They sent Klaatu to Earth to warn us, if we don\\'t solve our multi-nation conflicts, they would destroy Earth. After WW II and the atomic bomb, they have become concerned that an Earth nation would eventually threaten their civilization and peace.Of course there had to be a demonstration that Klaatu and his robot could really do this, so he did this at noon the next day, all over the Earth electricity was \"neutralized\" for exactly one half hour. Even batteries did not work, so cars and motorcycles or lawnmowers wouldn\\'t run, no phone, elevators, assembly line, etc. All except planes in the air and hospitals.To appreciate this film you have to realize WW II with the atomic bomb had ended only a few years earlier. The \"cold war\" was in full swing, with world-wide fear of the spread of Communism. So this was really a film with a message, to make a statement, that our nations need to figure out a way to live in peace or our Earth may be destroyed.It is curious watching the film\\'s message today, only a month after President Bush gave Saddam Hussein of Iraq essentially the same message that Klaatu gave in the movie - disarm or we\\'ll destroy you.  That\\'s the most eerie part of this movie.\\n\\n                    9 out of 12 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

This movie is my all-time favorite film of any genre, and no other science fiction movie has ever moved me like this one has. It is intelligently written, it\\'s premise is unique for the early 50\\'s..that an alien is benevolent and more evolved socially and technically and is not \\'the monster of the week\\' or out to harm us..and the casting of Michael Rennie in the role of Klaatu was inspired. With his tall, thin, angular look, he looks as if he might be from another world, yet he is handsome as well to make him appealing. His accent, too, makes him seem just a bit different. All in all, I have never been affected so deeply by a movie in my life, and it was (fittingly) the first VHS movie I ever bought back in 1979. Today, I have the DVD version as well. I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough, both for the quality of the production and story and for the message of international peace and cooperation which is still relevant today. We have not learned a great deal about getting along with each other in the more than 50 years since this film was released, and it still packs a punch.\\n\\n                    7 out of 9 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?  Sign in to vote.\\n                        \\n\\nPermalink\\n\\n \\nI\\'ll start this review saying that while many people won\\'t recognize his name, director Robert Wise was probably among the most creative directors of history, and among the most important; with a resume that includes not only this 50s classic, but also The Body Snatcher (1945), West Side Story (1961), The Sound of Music (1965) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979); his legacy is highly influential and surely will last forever.With that said, let\\'s start with \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", a movie that quickly gained a place among the classics of the Sci-Fi genre. The plot is very simple, but it is the way it is developed what is very moving, thought-provoking and also, quite scary. On a normal day, an alien space ship lands on Washington creating panic, when the mysterious visitor appears, he is suddenly attacked by the army. Surviving the attack, the alien explains that his purposes are pacific, and that he has an important message for the world. The U.S. government, immersed in its international intrigues, wants to have the message for themselves, but the alien, Klaatu(Michael Rennie) won\\'t give it to them only, as it is a message important for all the creatures on earth.The movie works at many levels, but at its core, it is an anti-war movie. Written in protest against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, it reflects the fears of the society in the 50s and the fear of nuclear holocaust. While Klaatu\\'s ultimate solution may seem like a bigger threat, it was indeed toned down, since in the source story it was the robot, Gort, who was the real master. It is a powerful message, and it is handled perfectly by Wise, in scenes when Klaatu in disguise, explores human nature guided by a boy.Unlike most of the sci-Fi movies, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" has not dated badly, in fact, its message remains as powerful and valid as the day it was released. The wars, the intrigues and complexities of our society make almost impossible the dream of world peace, and Klaatu\\'s perfect society seems unreachable for us.The superb work of Robert Wise would not be the same if it wasn\\'t for his SFX team, who did amazing things with very little. Also, the cast is superb, and while the dialogs may sound corny now, it is a very good script. Sure, it may have its share of plot holes, but the movie carries the message well and the overall product is near perfect.The acting is a bit typical of the 50s, nevertheless, it is worth to mention the superb performances of Michael Rennie as Klaatu, Sam Jaffe as the lead scientist and Billy Gray as the kid, Bobby Benson, who shows Klaatu the human world.The movie makes many points, and has various interpretations, from religious allegory to political critic, the story is timeless indeed. Many words could be written about this movie as it is one classic of cinema history that must be seen at least once in a life time. While we are probably too far from Klaatu\\'s perfect world, and the fear of a ultimate war is still present, we can hope that one day peace will be achieved.10/10.

Sometimes, it\\'s for their groundbreaking special effects, like the original King Kong (1933) or The War of the Worlds (1953). Sometimes it\\'s because they have a particularly interesting character or villain like Frankenstein (1931) and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958). And sometimes it\\'s because they feature a creature that absolutely frightens or haunts you like Count Orlok in Nosferatu (1922). But there\\'s only a handful of classics out there that get their recognition because of a moral message they carry. One such example is the original, Japanese version of Godzilla (1954). Another is the 1951 revolutionary classic The Day the Earth Stood Still.This memorable motion picture, recently remade with Keanu Reeves, and based on a story by Harry Bates, tells the fictional tale of an event in history when a flying saucer landed in Washington D.C. Two extra terrestrial beings emerged from its mysterious form. A humanlike messenger named Klaatu (Michael Rennie) and an eight-foot-tall, invulnerable robot called Gort (Lock Martin). These two beings arrive upon the era where mankind had began to strongly develop atomic energy and increase the violent and catastrophic potential of its warfare. The extra terrestrials arrive with a warning for all of mankind. By harnessing such horrible power and using it to create weapons, mankind was creating an intergalactic threat as well as endangering its own existence on Earth. Klaatu\\'s warning was simple: cut off the production of nuclear weapons and live in peace, or be destroyed as a threat to other worlds in the universe.Like many other popular science-fiction films, The Day the Earth Stood Still features impressive visual effects. Even the robot, Gort, which is nothing more than a man in a flexible costume, looks like a machine made from foreign-world material. The scenes where the UFO lands in Washington D.C. and where a death ray sprays into a tank and dissolves it in a flash of white light still spellbind to this day. But its more notable elements were created by the characters and by the screenwriters.The extra-terrestrial, Klaatu looks remarkably human. He doesn\\'t have antenna, or three eyes, or tentacles, and his physical form is not a disguise. Oddly enough, this is more convincing than the present standards for aliens, which have to look like animals, particularly invertebrates, to be believable. And because he looks human, Klaatu is more relatable as a being instead of a creature. And he has morals, again, relatable and more compelling a buggy-eyed, other-planet nihilist bent on enslavement and destruction. And besides, they way I see it, if there are other beings out in the world, they wouldn\\'t be much different than us. Physically or morally.Another noteworthy element is its symbolism, which like Godzilla (1954) stands out against nuclear war and the destruction of the environment. While it does not carry its message as vividly and horrifyingly, director Robert Wise wisely influences this message several times to keep it fresh in our minds. And while a movie cannot change the world, it is comforting to know that there were, and still are good people who realize these nightmarish elements of our world and feel compelled enough to communicate a message to us.The Day the Earth Stood Still has aged a bit since its debut in 1951, but this does in no way, take away from its influence. It has deservedly earned his place in the long list of classics from the age when true motion pictures were made instead of the standard, hackneyed projects that seem to attract audience members today in the 21st century.\\n\\n                    10 out of 15 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Here is the ne plus ultra for sci-fi movies. It does not pander to the child in us like E.T. It does not befuddle with dazzling images like 2001. Though it does present a threat from outer space, it does not take the form of a drooling, acid-for-blood whatsis with razor fangs and a hunger for human flesh. Instead, it proposes that there are indeed humanoid lifeforms in existence off the Earth with, dare I write it, powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men (though Klaatu can\\'t fly and is in no way bulletproof). THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is intelligent, engrossing and damn scary. Director Robert Wise (yup, he directed WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC and, unfortunately, the first STAR TREK movie), with the invaluable aid of Edmund H. North\\'s fine script, utilizes a spare, noirish style to deliver a powerful statement about man\\'s capacity for self-destruction. Only 92 minutes long, the film says volumes without sermonizing about a serious topic. And it does so most entertainingly. It makes the fantastic seem not only plausible but very likely. Bernard Herrmann creates a persistent mood of uneasiness with the vibrating eeriness of his Therimin-driven music. Michael Rennie\\'s urbane spaceman radiates a barely contained bemusement and contempt for the violence prone humans he faces. In this early role, Patricia Neal displays how gifted she was at conveying subtle emotional shifts. Through the eyes of Billy Gray we see wonder, puzzlement and terror as only a child can experience them but without condescension. Lastly, in all the annals of sci-fi moviedom few can match the unstoppable power of Gort. Klaatu barada nikto..... (And please don\\'t waste your time with the utter failure that is the 2008 Keanu Reeves remake; just revel in the enduring excellence of the original).\\n\\n                    6 out of 8 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Enter General Eisenhower, who would become a two-term U.S. President; \"Father Knows Best\", with its stern but loving father figure; and the iron-fisted biblical epic: \"The Ten Commandments\".Enter, too, \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\", a 1951 sci-fi classic soaked in images of authority ... the police, the military, and the tall, stern, Moses-like figure from another world, Klaatu, who lectures us on the folly of nuclear war. It is, I believe, this pacifist message emanating from strength that explains the film\\'s enduring popularity.Noble as the message is, what about its cinematic vehicle? Visually and musically, the film is appropriately frigid and forbidding. Leo Tover\\'s noirish B&W lighting and unobtrusive camera work, combined with Bernard Herrmann\\'s score and the eerie theramin sounds all work in concert to convey a mood of Orwellian severity and other worldly coldness.But the script is disappointing. This is a very talky film, which dilutes its effectiveness as sci-fi. The dialogue seems stodgy, canned, uninspired. Example: \"attention zone 5, attention zone 5, yellow cab moving north ... man and woman in backseat; get license number and report ... deploy all units according to Plan B immediately\" (well, at least it was not Plan 9...).This pedestrian script could have been borrowed from most any cops and robbers flick of the 40\\'s. On the other hand, I guess I can forgive the script\\'s moratorium on humor, given the seriousness of the message.The film\\'s science is very dated, thus requiring further tolerance. Klaatu to scientists: \"The universe grows smaller every day\"; no, actually the physical universe is expanding. \"Venus and Mars ... are the only two planets capable of sustaining life as we know it\"; no, not with their temperature extremes and chemical composition.And the special effects are curiously minimal in the same era that produced the beautifully weird gliding machines from Mars in \"War Of The Worlds\" (1953), and the lurking terror in \"Forbidden Planet\" (1956).One solid accomplishment of this film is its accurate portrayal of society in the early 1950\\'s: the old cars, men\\'s formal attire (especially those hats), interior decor, antiquated TV sets, and of course the confidence in institutional authority.In summary then, the movie, for me, functions less as a credible sci-fi vehicle than as a fascinating socio-political commentary on American life in the early 1950\\'s.\\n\\n                    43 out of 85 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

            "its odd to think that fifty years from now there may only be a handful of movies released in  that will be remembered at all i dont care to venture any guesses as to what they may be but its easy to see why the day the earth stood still is one of the ones from  that remains a classic while so many others sank into obscurity the movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples minds in the early  in america and the rest of the world and that is the conflicts between many different nations and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other it was released at the time of the red scare and so soon after world war ii that international tensions were still high also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title why its not very frightening at allokay that made no sense but i couldnt resist my respect for the movie dimmed sharply when i saw that the alien was not only a man but a good looking man who spoke perfect english but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years unlikely but its an explanation which is more than most science fiction films provide granted not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction but in this case something had to be said the alien didnt give may details as to his physical condition but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human he must have a similar environment to our own on his planetspeaking of which there is one thing about the science that im also curious about at what stage were astronomical studies in the early  im wondering how far into space scientists were looking because carpenter the alien states with some grandeur that he has traveled  million miles to get to earth which in astronomical terms is a tiny tiny distance considering that the sun is  million miles from earth this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system and heres another little factoid  earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year as you know pluto on the other hand takes something like  years to revolve around the sun that has nothing to do with the movie but is an interesting digression i should thinki found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time it was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda oxymoron intended i actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument haswhen carpenter who they stopped just short of simply naming jesus was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations he was genuinely surprised and saddened he gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the earths atmosphere and since humans clearly are unable to get along he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration most importantly if we chose the latter they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space the descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one anotherthis is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that jonathan swift presented in utopia his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted they have created robots which we seen in the iron man to prevent the rise of violence in their society the robots have tremendous power which cannot be revoked and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor which results in a peaceful society im also reminded of gullivers travels also by jonathan swift particularly the section where gulliver lives among the houynymns which interestingly enough are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace when at one point gulliver describes lying which does not exist to the houynymns one of them responds incredulously with something like why on earth would one say something that isnt so carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own worldthe famous quote that ive quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents and evil dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that ash had such a hard time speaking in army of darkness the genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones and i think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world as the day the earth stood still obviously does given the political atmosphere here in the first month of  its obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie but then again

            "the day the earth stood still  outta  stars wow a classic science fiction movie that i had never seen until now sure some of the acting and stuff may look a little hokey to jaded modern audiences but this movie is still extremely welldone like a movielength episode of the twilight zone one of the better ones a spaceship lands in washington and a traveler steps forth before he even has a chance to get a word out the us army takes a shot at him causing his robot companion to destroy some military hardware the alien klaatu michael rennie tries to reason with the us government but of course gets nowhere so he escapes and travels among humankind to try and get a handle on why people are so suspicious and untrusting he gets a room in a boarding house and makes friends with a pretty widow patricia neal and her young son mankind has just come upon the means of using atomic energy as a weapon and klaatu is here to make sure that humans wont pose a threat to other worlds or else wellwritten suspenseful and thoughtprovoking even today amazing how so little has changed in  years\n",

            "ok maybe thats dramatic but its true im not nearly as old as this film and the first time i saw it i was a young child and impressionable as only young children are i can honestly say that every alien encounter ive experienced through movies tv shows and literature has been measured against the day the earth stood still and most have come up short i credit the films depiction of humanalien interactions with my presentday feelings about how people should treat each other  within communities and groups and how we often fail in our dealings with outsiders i think the movie made the young girl i was think about issues that would otherwise have gone unexamined for many years to come and in those years i would have become a different person the effect was deeply profound and remains so even  years after my first screening that said it is still entertaining a joy to revisit there are no expensive hitech special effects that look great in teasers but do nothing for the plot its very straight forward honest pure its emotional and intellectual instead of the typical shootemup space battle films that are todays norm and while i enjoy a good explosion now and then the change of pace is refreshing\n",

            "i just saw this yesterday for the first time and boy do i feel stupid   its not my fault though its rarely on television but was it worth the waitthe plot is fairly simple and direct visitor from another planet has come to warn us that we are aggressive paranoid and dangerous to ourselves and the other planets if we continue with atomic bombs  klaatu does not care if we kill each other but cannot tolerate what atomic bombs can do to the other planets  naturally he is not welcomed with open arms but in our defense he was not exactly invited  the most disturbing part is that this movie is more timely than ever right now  when klaatu mentions levelling new york i got a chill  one or two moments were slightly puzzling  why does klaatu allow himself to be interviewed on television when he knows he is being tracked down  why is he being pursued at the end so vigorously when he was scheduled to address the world  and why did patricia neal have to be brought onto the spaceship at the end  it seems to serve no purposeno matter this is still a great movie that i would be thrilled to see again  \n",

            "when a space ship lands in the middle of a playing field in washington the military respond with an immediate shut down of the area  the inhabitant of the space ship exits bearing a gift but is shot by soldiers mistaking it for a weapon  seconds after the shot a large robot exits and destroys all the weapons  the alien klaatu is taken to a hospital and asks for an audience with all the world leaders  when he is refused he escapes the hospital and takes a room in a small guest home incognito  the man hunt starts as klaatu seeks to deliver his message to earth and avert disasterin a sea of  scifi this film easily stands out as a classic that gave so much to popular culture  the score alone has been aped or lifted in the simpsons case in many other films  the plot is very different to the others of the period as it is a peaceful message it sends rather than a beware the red menace message of fear and hate  in fact one character even says she thinks the alien is from earth ie russia only to be hushed  the film lacks action but makes up for it with a solemn mood and genuine thoughtfulness as klaatu learns more about humans and tries to reconcile what he sees with what he sees in the wider world as a wholein recent hindsight it is impossible not to look at klaatus warning of disarm or well remove your threat by destroying you in the same light isnt this the same warning and actions that bush and blair made recently ill leave you with that thought but i found it difficult to understand klaatus preemptive strike while holding a critical view of bushsthat aside the films production is very polished  the score is excellent and really gives the film an alien feel to it  the direction makes use of ordinary sets to good effect  the very idea of the space ship landing in washington is obvious but to have it land on a baseball field is a clever way to show it striking sorry  accidental pun at the heart of ordinary america  the cast do well and mostly rise above the clichés set by the genre  rennie does good work as klaatu and neal is more than just a screamer as helen  of course we have to have a wideeyed all american boy bobby but it could easily be johnny or jimmy to see the whole thing but he does okoverall this is a classic of the genre that has passed on so much to modern audiences  the pacifist message is refreshing when viewed along side so many other of the period which used the aliens to warn against the spread of communism but the ease with which you now accept klaatus threat of a preemptive strike will depend on your political views over the past few months\n",

            "ill start this review saying that while many people wont recognize his name director robert wise was probably among the most creative directors of history and among the most important with a resume that includes not only this  classic but also the body snatcher  west side story  the sound of music  and star trek the motion picture  his legacy is highly influential and surely will last foreverwith that said lets start with the day the earth stood still a movie that quickly gained a place among the classics of the scifi genre the plot is very simple but it is the way it is developed what is very moving thoughtprovoking and also quite scary on a normal day an alien space ship lands on washington creating panic when the mysterious visitor appears he is suddenly attacked by the army surviving the attack the alien explains that his purposes are pacific and that he has an important message for the world the us government immersed in its international intrigues wants to have the message for themselves but the alien klaatumichael rennie wont give it to them only as it is a message important for all the creatures on earththe movie works at many levels but at its core it is an antiwar movie written in protest against the proliferation of nuclear weapons it reflects the fears of the society in the  and the fear of nuclear holocaust while klaatus ultimate solution may seem like a bigger threat it was indeed toned down since in the source story it was the robot gort who was the real master it is a powerful message and it is handled perfectly by wise in scenes when klaatu in disguise explores human nature guided by a boyunlike most of the scifi movies the day the earth stood still has not dated badly in fact its message remains as powerful and valid as the day it was released the wars the intrigues and complexities of our society make almost impossible the dream of world peace and klaatus perfect society seems unreachable for usthe superb work of robert wise would not be the same if it wasnt for his sfx team who did amazing things with very little also the cast is superb and while the dialogs may sound corny now it is a very good script sure it may have its share of plot holes but the movie carries the message well and the overall product is near perfectthe acting is a bit typical of the  nevertheless it is worth to mention the superb performances of michael rennie as klaatu sam jaffe as the lead scientist and billy gray as the kid bobby benson who shows klaatu the human worldthe movie makes many points and has various interpretations from religious allegory to political critic the story is timeless indeed many words could be written about this movie as it is one classic of cinema history that must be seen at least once in a life time while we are probably too far from klaatus perfect world and the fear of a ultimate war is still present we can hope that one day peace will be  magnificent\n",

            "many of the old blackandwhite sciencefiction classics are often remembered for a particularly grand element they have to them sometimes its for their groundbreaking special effects like the original king kong  or the war of the worlds  sometimes its because they have a particularly interesting character or villain like frankenstein  and the  voyage of sinbad  and sometimes its because they feature a creature that absolutely frightens or haunts you like count orlok in nosferatu  but theres only a handful of classics out there that get their recognition because of a moral message they carry one such example is the original japanese version of godzilla  another is the  revolutionary classic the day the earth stood stillthis memorable motion picture recently remade with keanu reeves and based on a story by harry bates tells the fictional tale of an event in history when a flying saucer landed in washington dc two extra terrestrial beings emerged from its mysterious form a humanlike messenger named klaatu michael rennie and an eightfoottall invulnerable robot called gort lock martin these two beings arrive upon the era where mankind had began to strongly develop atomic energy and increase the violent and catastrophic potential of its warfare the extra terrestrials arrive with a warning for all of mankind by harnessing such horrible power and using it to create weapons mankind was creating an intergalactic threat as well as endangering its own existence on earth klaatus warning was simple cut off the production of nuclear weapons and live in peace or be destroyed as a threat to other worlds in the universelike many other popular sciencefiction films the day the earth stood still features impressive visual effects even the robot gort which is nothing more than a man in a flexible costume looks like a machine made from foreignworld material the scenes where the ufo lands in washington dc and where a death ray sprays into a tank and dissolves it in a flash of white light still spellbind to this day but its more notable elements were created by the characters and by the screenwritersthe extraterrestrial klaatu looks remarkably human he doesnt have antenna or three eyes or tentacles and his physical form is not a disguise oddly enough this is more convincing than the present standards for aliens which have to look like animals particularly invertebrates to be believable and because he looks human klaatu is more relatable as a being instead of a creature and he has morals again relatable and more compelling a buggyeyed otherplanet nihilist bent on enslavement and destruction and besides they way i see it if there are other beings out in the world they wouldnt be much different than us physically or morallyanother noteworthy element is its symbolism which like godzilla  stands out against nuclear war and the destruction of the environment while it does not carry its message as vividly and horrifyingly director robert wise wisely influences this message several times to keep it fresh in our minds and while a movie cannot change the world it is comforting to know that there were and still are good people who realize these nightmarish elements of our world and feel compelled enough to communicate a message to usthe day the earth stood still has aged a bit since its debut in  but this does in no way take away from its influence it has deservedly earned his place in the long list of classics from the age when true motion pictures were made instead of the standard hackneyed projects that seem to attract audience members today in the  century\n",

movie i usually enjoy college silly movies or even some high school centered movies but this was too much for me only good reason to see this movie might be for a drinking game take a shot every time they say omg this movie is surfing big time the pokémon go wave it is an ode to so many things that as an adultare bothering me the social media addictionvinefb instagram it puts egocentrism greed instant gratification instant fame into the spotlight it encourages people to break the rules for fame it makes attention seekers extreme thrill seekers looks cool but at the end there is a nice little twist and a lame moralizing lesson which tells us do not go too far friendship and life is more important awwww so true soooo nice buttoo late the movie just spent  min showing people that all this crap was cool pretty much being an enabler validating addictive dangerous behaviors in front of a young susceptible audience or an older audience wondering why the hell i am here we all read stories of selfie takers who fell from a crane or roof or cliff because they were trying to score a cool shot for their social media profiles the movie is rather fast paced but it is just watching a

idiotic this movie was i was fooled by the  average but then i realized  of the people watching this movie were below  so like i said in my opening statement this is for a younger audience who might

novel by jeanne ryan jessica sharzer speak american horror story adapted the work for the screen and the directors are henry joost and ariel schuman both known mostly for catfish so far the lead actress is emma roberts and the only other cast members i knew in here were her colead dave franco brother of james and juliette lewis playing the main characters mother most of the cast also because of the subject are pretty young aspiring actors that do not yet have a big name i kinda liked emily meade even if the friendship story between her and the main character was one of the weakest parts of the film and i can see her having a good future in film but lets look a bit at the now and this movie it is a take on big brother with a mix of hunger games and an ounce of david finchers the game so if you hear all this you already know it is a mostly dark take on the age of surveillance here we have a young woman who gets told by her best friend that she just isnt taking enough risks to lead a fulfilling life so she agrees to join in a virtual reality game called nerve in which she gets watched constantly by thousands of people while she has to fulfill quests these quests quickly get her to join forces with francos characterand from that moment on the two are out there together and the watchers see them and hope for them to start a relationship there is some situational comedy in this film and this was mostly working well but sadly in stark contrast to that the real core of the film was not working for the most part i am referring to the dramatic thriller sequences they start off okay but the script is quickly lost in a whirlwind of desperate attempts to become more controversial more shocking and more relevant the social commentarycriticism which is what the film really is all about also with a reference to our world becomes complete garbage at some point and lacks realism entirely one major problem is roberts main character in one scene she is scared to step on the motorcycle in the next she accelerated the bike with her driver blindfolded a rush of adrenaline cannot explain that same can be said about the ladder climbing scene lets not forget this film takes place over the course of one eveningnight and i just refuse to believe a character would change like that from one second to the next on all these contradictory occasionsat some point i felt the film really went for nothing than shock value and it was very empty and irrelevant as a consequence police wont do anything to stop the hosts of the game even after a kid died earlier and probably more did if we are taking into account all the risky action but a teenage boy and his pals can hack into the system and send messages that call everybody an accessory to murder this was maybe the most embarrassing moment even if the idea about ending it at the very end felt very false as a whole and why would everybody even the bad guy know about her plan but francos character the one closest to her would not know there were just so many scenes that did not make any sense at all in the second half of the film emma roberts did not impress me at all sure this is a film that is much more about the story and plot than about individual performances but i was shocked how irrelevant her character and performance felt throughout the entire film a more gifted actress certainly could have elevated the material and her speech in front of the crowd at the very end was nothing special either more on the cringeworthy side franco a fairly mediocre actor himself looked really strong next too her and juliette lewis oh well i felt almost sorry for her about what they gave her in terms of the script the character added absolutely nothing at all but thats not lewis fault just because of the way she was written apart from that i refuse to believe that the crowd would really want a certain character here to die first of all humans arent that cruel second of all we were led to believe they loved her immediately the moment she entered the game make up your mind filmmakers and please dont give me the argument of peoples opinions changing fastokay enough said i am fairly disappointed here this was definitely a missed opportunity the film showed some solid premise early but it quickly turned into a huge mess i am actually glad it was relatively short and did not get any closer to the twohour mark i have not read the book this is based on so no idea who is to blame and if the base material is also really weak but if not then i cannot image ryan being too happy with the way this turned out overall i just hope they dont get the idea at some point to make a sequel here this original was already underwhelming enough i certainly do not recommend the watch the longer it went the worse it became also with the ridiculously bad rushedin happy ending for everybody stay away from this film                     out of  found this helpful                                                    was

surprises to be discoveredthe good this films premise is definitely a fun one and at the least this movie was almost constantly entertaining the dares that these people are forced to do as well as the reasons for why people are playing this game are things i found very fun and interestingemma roberts and dave franco both give solid performances in this film and they each work well off of each other roberts as vee accurately depicts a high school senior struggling with social problems as well as college even if roberts herself looks like she graduated from high school six years ago francos character was also an intriguing one and he grew on me the more the film progressedi enjoyed nearly every moment when a legitimate dare was being done as they were handled very well and created tension excellently the style of this movie is also a reason as to why this film feels original as the sleek visuals create some very cool scenesthe bad nerve can be very fun when it wants to be but the problem is that it also takes itself way too seriously in many scenes this movie tries to get serious towards the end and become dramatic and have important themes but it all comes across as incredibly dull and tediousspeaking of the ending no matter how serious the movie thinks it is it is absolutely stupid the whole plan doesnt make much sense at all and there are way too many unanswerable questions to just let go how convoluted it iswhile i did like roberts and franco i had a massive problem with emily meadewhether it is the design of her character or the performance meade is completely unlikable and lacks any sense at all and that would be okay if we are supposed to be against her instead the movie expects us to feel sorry for her which i found impossible to domy biggest fear coming in was that the trailer gave away too much of the main ploti wouldnt say the trailer gave away too much i would say the trailer gave away everything every single scene besides two in particular i saw coming a mile away because of one individual trailer and i think it completely ruined my film going experience nearly every dare every important conflict and even the plot twist can be found within this movies official trailer and i highly recommend avoiding that trailer like the plague if you have any interest in seeing this movieconclusion nerve has good performances from its two leads and a unique visual style and it certainly has its fair share of entertainment however though it might not be fair the trailer absolutely ruined my experience by giving away the vast majority of the plot even besides that there are issues in the films storytelling and whenever the movie tries to be taken seriously it falls flat on its face nerve has its moments but falls apart

too old in age to watch this movie it might aim at teenagers to me a grownup middle aged man the movie was boring and predictable all boys and girls have stereotype characters especially boring is the fact that all characters are very conservative thinking not much youth in them they all go a bit wild during playing the game nerve but after moral not ethics catches them up they fall back in place and will live ordinary boring lives what remains after leaving the cinema is the depressing fact that our digital world can only be thought as going mad that internet brings out mostly the bad side of

must have wet themselves with excitement that the pokemon go craze aligned so nicely with the release of their film i was delighted that at last this summer there is a film with a modicum of originality i can enthuse about vee short for venus emma roberts niece of julia roberts is an nyc teen living in the shadow of a family tragedy and the claustrophobic presence of her overprotective mother juliette lewis cape fear always timidly in the shadow of her best friend – the extrovert sydney emily meade – vee poohpoohs sydneys compulsion with the new viral internet game nerve a social media truth or dare but without the truth challenge game where you can either be a player or a watcher in real time watchers set players with challenges they have to complete for everescalating financial rewards but bail or fail and you lose all and snitches get stitcheswith their friendship at breaking point vee is provoked into playing the game by sydney and teams with fellow gamer ian dave franco younger brother of james franco – someone with a history that could bring vee into great danger however vees geeky wannabe boyfriend tommy miles heizer is on the casewhat is so impressive about this film is that the screenplay by jessica sharzer based on a novel by jeanne ryan is genuinely original and is delivered with style and good humor sure you can draw parallels for any film with many other sources in here there are traces of hunger gamesallegiance the simon says portion of die hard  perhaps a soupçon of gladiator and schwartzneggers running man in the mix but this is a novel approach to a teen flick bang on the topical money in bringing in the frenetically viral nature of social media and aspects of the dark web cyber security and open source programmingthe film manages to generate significant credibility about the impact that a game like this would have among a teen audience and there is a telling message in the finale that it is easy to be a troll without responsibility hiding behind an internet ident but when the masks come off and the message back becomes personal then your responsibilities as an individual human can come home to roost the film is delivered with style and verve as well with innovative graphics a great title and end title design and an augmented reality overlay of the action showing players and watchers across the city many of the challenges are executed really well with a few seatclenchingly tense moments particularly if you have a poor head for heightsbut with all this potential it unfortunately fails to be a  classic smelling at times of b movie which is a great shame emma roberts is fine at what she does but at times i longed for the dramatic depth of a shailene woodley or chloe grace moretz with the scenes with the underused but excellent juliette lewis rather highlighting this differentialthe otherwise excellent script is – for me – let down by a scene of maleonfemale violence which i found both distasteful and unnecessary and a coding geeks shall inherit the earth moment towards the end is a little too glib for my liking but overall the directors henry joost and ariel schulman paranormal activity  and  have done a fine job with a  budget regular readers of my blog bobthemoviemancom may recall my use of the bvs quotient – the number of films that could be made from the budget of batman vs superman this one has a bvs quotient of  meaning you could make over  of these instead of the superhero dud yes please although if they had doubled the budget and rounded off some of the sharp corners this could have been a true classic its still recommended for a memorable movie experience though and probably makes it into my draft movies of the year list so farfor the graphical version of this review

community called nerve of adrenalinejunkies where anonymous watchers can dare players to do well whatever they want to see someone do from start to finish this film is a nonstop whiteknuckle thrill ride that is exciting intense romantic and most importantly a lot of fun trust me you will have a smile on your face the entire runtime of this movie and youll also be on the edge of your seat now im going to be honest maybe my low expectations made this movie better to me than it really is but i cant help that i had an absolute blast watching this filmone thing that was great about this movie was that the dares were realistic and didnt feel ridiculous all of the things that venus is dared to do are things that you know actually could happen in real life the dares range from her getting a tattoo to her having to go  miles per hour on a motorcycle while the driver ian dave franco is blindfolded and while the dares get more and more intense as the film goes on nothing felt overly unbelievable or too exaggerated just for the sake of putting it in the filmand watching venus and ian complete their dares and gain money was so much fun to watch their chemistry was fantastic and i bought their friendship throughout the film what can i say they made a cute onscreen couple it was also satisfying to see venus go from a shy and timid girl to an adrenaline junky but hey id do the same thing if someone was offering me thousands of dollars the world building in this film was very believable as well the game of nerve felt like a phenomenon and it actually felt like something that could happen in real life there were shots of the city that showed the different usernames of all of the different people who were logged into the game and this was an effective way of conveying just how popular nerve was in the films universethe color palette was also hypnotizing bright vibrant neon reds blues and purples are a feast for the eyes and the soundtrack which is comprised of light techno music accompanies and mixes with the colors very well and fits the overall tone of the filmnerve is a fantastically fun and incredibly intense movie that has great chemistry between emma roberts and dave franco great visuals to go with an awesome soundtrack and cool action sequences in the form of the dares that the characters have to complete i would highly recommend this film to

online in real life it was fun to see how far some people would go to win some of the cinematography and lighting was really good i really loved the effect used on the film poster certain scenes were quite tense and you can almost imagine what you might do in that situation emma roberts did a good job in her rolethe message at the end was kinda silly and tacked on it needed working on songs often

completing challenges and dares to increase her popularity and add to her bank balance but as you would expect not everything goes to plan before i start to criticise this film too much its true to say that im not the kind of person this is aimed at what i mean is im probably  years too old to really enjoy something like this its incredibly dumb the story is so far fetched and unrealistic that you just dont buy into what you are watching it seams to be set in a neon lit world where everyone is  years old and where no internet connection is lost  nothing buffers and camera phones are conveniently aimed on every scene but the biggest problem with this is that its not gritty enough i wanted see a game like jigsaw would play in the saw film but instead we see a tepid watered down version and that just bored me unless you  years old give this a miss the best thing about nerve is the soundtrack                      out of  found this helpful

hearts of viewers still race hours after the end for those who want a deep discussion starting movie the door is there for those who want to open it theres no overt pressure from the movie to draw a certain conclusion or for watchers to take a certain stance on social media rather it presents an unbiased entry into the thrilling world of social media with its upsides and downsides franco and roberts display superb acting in the way they manifest of their characters history and unique motives through the course of the adrenalinefilled night nerve provides a stunning look at the different personalities and impulses that draw people to social media without explicitly labeling motives as wrong or right nerve comes at an especially relevant time with the increasing concern over social media and its consequences and the directors produced a wonderful spark to incite discussion and awareness on this important topic however theres no force on audiences to answer to the social media dilemma viewers draw their own conclusions as their personalities and thoughts guide them through the movie nerve is quite the package theres enough nerveracking displays to keep your hearts thumping

ripoff of the interesting thai flick  game of death albeit with a teenfriendly rating and a young adult feel so that you know things are never going to get too explicit or disturbing the most interesting thing about this one is the commentary on the internet age which comes as little surprise given the directors are the guys behind catfish sadly the plot itself is meandering and overlong interesting during the setpiece challenges but entirely routine otherwise the film loses points for starring the vapid emma roberts as the lead a totally unlikeable and insubstantial figure and dave

the world and just deletes the game with a little help of his ping pong enthusiasts unrealistic parent dead brother btw he is dead just so we could feel sorry for her and it gets mentioned for like  seconds so again lazy character dev so she decides to take on an advanture that can literally be stopped at any time in the movie with submitting the photographic evidence to the police and ending the game immediately and then this little girl who is not  yet btw outsmarts the whole hacker team behind the game and orchestrates a fantastic plan in a matter of seconds to stop the game just so we

themed movies in the same way found movies did havent we got enough social media in the world without making movies about it i suspect this will appeal to the younger person but it just didnt do it for me i feel this movie has missed the boat somewhatweve already had the icebucket challenge cinnamon challenge drinking challenges etc etc etc i agree totally that some clown will try to invent something like this and there will always be bigger clowns who will try to compensate for their lack of a brain by morphing into a sheep and baaaa copying it i dare folks to live without their phones

For example, max_df = 0.50 means \"ignore terms that appear in more than 50% of the documents,\" max_df = 25 means \"ignore terms that appear in more than 25 documents,\" and the default max_df is 1.0, which means \"ignore terms that appear in more than 100% of the documents.\" Thus, the default setting does not ignore any terms.</font>\n"

        "Another popular text analysis technique is called topic modeling. The ultimate goal of topic modeling is to find various topics that are present in your corpus. Each document in the corpus will be made up of at least one topic, if not multiple topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be covering the steps on how to do **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, which is one of many topic modeling techniques. It was specifically designed for text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use a topic modeling technique, you need to provide (1) a document-term matrix and (2) the number of topics you would like the algorithm to pick up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the topic modeling technique is applied, your job as a human is to interpret the results and see if the mix of words in each topic make sense. If they don't make sense, you can try changing up the number of topics, the terms in the document-term matrix, model parameters, or even try a different model.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's read in our document-term matrix."
